        <h1>Understand subledger datasets</h1>
        <p>See <a href="#Subledger">Subledger datasets described</a> for the types of subledger dataset you can import into Caseware Cloud. Each dataset description lists the mandatory and optional fields making up transactions for that type of subledger dataset and the purpose of each field. The diagram below explains the basic elements of the subledger dataset descriptions.</p>
