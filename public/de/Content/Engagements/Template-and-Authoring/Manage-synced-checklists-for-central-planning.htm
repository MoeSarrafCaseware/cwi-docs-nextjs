        <h1>Manage synced checklists for central planning</h1>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This feature is only available if it has been enabled in your product.</p>
        <p>If central planning is available in your product, you can modify which checklists are synced from the central planning engagement to the destination engagements. This allows you to customize central planning to suit your firm and needs, as well as include firm author-created checklists.</p>
        <p>To modify which checklists are synced in central planning engagements, select the <b>Information</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-information.png" alt=" " style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) at the top menu and choose <b>Settings</b> to open the Product Settings dialog. On the <b>Central Planning</b> tab, use the checkboxes to select which checklist documents in your firm template are synced. All risks and controls are synced by default.</p>
