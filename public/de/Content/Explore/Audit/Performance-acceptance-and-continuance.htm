        <h1>„Acceptance and Continuance“ (Annahme und Fortführung) Prozesse durchführen</h1><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresAuditCloud.flsnp" /> <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Beta-proviso.flsnp" /><p>The documents that you need to complete to perform the acceptance and continuance procedures are automatically generated based on your responses to the Planning Optimiser questions.</p>
        <p>For example, you may specify that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This is not the first year of operation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You are the accountant that performed the audit for this client last year.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The accounting framework is ASPE.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on the above, the following documents populate in the <b>Documents</b> page:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>410 Engagement acceptance/continuance</b></p>
                <p>This is a checklist assessing whether the level of risk is acceptable for the firm and the engagement preconditions have been met.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>415.1 Engagement letter - Standard ASPE</b></p>
                <p>This is a letter to be reviewed prior to sending it to the client.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>415.2 Client query - Engagement letter - Standard ASPE</b></p>
                <p>This is a query document used for file sharing and collaboration with your clients. This is where you send the letter to the client, and the client returns the signed letter.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Notify the document&apos;s reviewer</h2>
        <p>To notify the staff member acting as the reviewer that the acceptance document is ready for review, add an issue and assign it to them.</p>
        <p><b>To add an issue: </b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>With the document open, select the <b>Issue</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/issues-in-document-inline.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</li>
            <li>Enter a message for the staff member.<br /><p class="tip"><b>Tipp:</b> You can also tag a member by entering (@) followed by the member name. If they have access to the document, their name appears in the Quick List dialog.<br />Select their name to tag them in the issue&apos;s description.</p></li>
            <li>Choose the issue type and select <b>Create Issue.</b></li>
            <li>The issue displays in the document. It also displays in the Issues page or on the <b>Documents</b> page.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once all required roles sign off on a document, the green check mark displays next to the document (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/sign-off-icons-reviewed-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) on the <b>Documents</b> page. The progress indicator for the <b>Planning</b> phase is also updated.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Phase-progress-indicator.flsnp" /><h2>Review and edit the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>A draft version of the engagement letter is generated in the engagement based on your responses in the Planning Optimiser.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Hinweis:</b> You must accept the last item in the <b>405 Engagement acceptance/continuance</b> checklist document to have the letter populated in the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
        <p>Notes and guidance information are available in the letter at the section marked with a lightbulb icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/light-bulb-icon-guidance.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />). This section is visible by default but it&apos;s excluded when you print the letter. To hide this section select <b>More Actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/more-actions-inline.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) from the top right of document 415.1, and select <b>Collapsed</b> from the list that displays.</p>
        <p>To edit the letter content, select <b>Edit</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
        <p>Once you&apos;re satisfied with the contents of the engagement letter, select Sign Off to perform the appropriate sign off. Once the content is reviewed, you can send a copy to your client.</p>
        <h2>Send the letter to clients for review and signature</h2>
        <p>To obtain the client signature, you can send your draft directly to clients using query documents in Audit. Query documents are intended for client collaboration, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requesting information from clients (send inquiries).</li>
            <li>Requesting documents (ask the client to upload one or more files).</li>
            <li>Sending deliverables to the client to sign and return.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once client contacts sign in to Cloud, they can directly respond to queries.</p>
        <p><b>To send the engagement letter to your clients:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <b>415.2 Client query - Engagement letter - Standard ASPE</b> document.</li>
            <li>In the top-right corner of the document, select <b>SEND</b>.<br />The Open Query dialog opens.</li>
            <li>Select a <b>Query Due Date</b>.</li>
            <li>Specify the contacts assigned to the engagement (or simply assign it to all contacts associated with the entity).</li>
            <li>Enter an appropriate email message.</li>
            <li>Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche <b>OK</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Contacts receive an email with your message and a link to the engagement, where they can download a PDF version of the letter, sign and upload the signed copy.</p>
