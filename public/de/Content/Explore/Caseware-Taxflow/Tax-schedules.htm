        <h1>Tax schedules</h1><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/caseware-taxflow-vendors-note.flsnp" /><p>Casware Taxflow includes tax schedules that are relevant to your organization type, where you can review tax adjustments and final tax balances. Depending on your organization type, applicable Tax schedules are available under the <b>Tax preparation and export</b> phase on the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
        <p>Tax schedules include the following tax information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Tax reclassifying adjustments</b> posted for each tax group.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Book-to-tax reconciliation adjustments</b> posted for each tax group.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <b>Adjusted financial balances</b> and <b>Final tax balances</b> are automatically calculated in tax schedules using the <b>Final financial balances</b> and posted tax adjustments. You can also view the calculated <b>Final tax result</b>.</p>
        <p>Tax schedules can be exported to Microsoft Excel. Each tab can be exported individually. Where sub-groups exist, parent tax groups will be excluded from the export, to avoid data duplication.</p>
