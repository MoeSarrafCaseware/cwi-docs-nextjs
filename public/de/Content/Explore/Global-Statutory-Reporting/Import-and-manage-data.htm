        <h1>Daten importieren und verwalten</h1>
        <p>You can import trial balance, general ledger and subledger data into your engagement from a variety of sources.</p>
        <p>Data import files, such as Excel or CSV files, are referred to as data sources, which you can then configure and assign to a dataset on the <strong>Datasets</strong> page. Multiple data sources can be assigned to a single dataset. In addition, you can also import unstructured data—data that cannot be readily assigned to any of the existing dataset types—by selecting the Other dataset type. The import source and dataset options available to you vary based on your product.</p>
        <p>Any engagement can have several types of datasets, which are collections of data normally found in an engagement. Each dataset stores data related to a different aspect of an engagement and has predetermined fields. See descriptions of datasets and their fields in <MadCap:xref href="#Dataset">Dataset types described</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> The <strong>Datasets</strong> page is not available for data imported from Working Papers or from another engagement. It is available for trial balance data imported from CSV or Excel only if enabled in your product.</p>
        <p>To learn more about importing and managing your data, see:</p>
