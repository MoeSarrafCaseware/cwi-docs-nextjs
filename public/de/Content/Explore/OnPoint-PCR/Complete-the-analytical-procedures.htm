        <p>
            <p>Complete the <b>2-400 - Review Overall Analysis</b> document to form predictions of recorded amounts or ratios developed from recorded amounts - a process known as forming expectations.</p>
        </p>
        <p>The document also contains an Analysis tab with graphs and tables, so you can look for trends, compare and calculate ratios, investigate discrepancies and confirm expectations.</p>
        <p>In the <b>2-400 - Review Overall Analysis</b> document, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Hide or display specific charts by selecting the toggles (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-toggle-analysis.png" />) at the top of the page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use the drop-downs at the top to switch the display between Adjusted balances and Unadjusted balances.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter comments or notes in the designated section in each chart or table.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Hover a graph or table to view a tooltip that shows what data the hovered row, bar or line represents.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/overall-analysis.png" alt="Review overall analysis." /></p>
        <p>If you hover the data labels in the graph table, a tooltip displays showing the definition of each label and the formula used to calculate it.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/2-400-review-overall-analysis.png" alt="Review overall analysis." /></p>
        <p>In graphs, you can remove one or more data set from the figure and compare results. Select Edit (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-chart.png" />), then select Delete (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-close-figure.png" />) to remove one or more data set. You can revert to the original chart by selecting the Edit (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-chart.png" />) then Revert (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-reset-to-default-16x16.png" />).</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/profitability-ratios.png" alt="Profitability ratios." /></p>
        <p>Complete <b>2-450 Trial balance analysis</b>.</p>
        <p>Use this document to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Document any fluctuations or relationships that are inconsistent with other relevant information.</li>
            <li>Document any fluctuations that differ from expected values by significant amounts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Hinweis:</b> The current year balances in the <b>2-450 Trial balance analysis</b> document will change with your adjustments. For best practice, print a PDF copy of the analysis of unadjusted amounts before recording any adjustments, then save in the engagement file.<img src="../../Resources/Images/trial-balance-analysis.png" alt="Trial balance analysis." /></p>
