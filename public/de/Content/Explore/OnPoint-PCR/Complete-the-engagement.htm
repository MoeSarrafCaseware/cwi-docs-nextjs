        <h1>Engagement vervollständigen</h1><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresPCR.flsnp" /><h2><a name="Complete"></a>Complete the relevant checklists and send the Representation letter</h2>
        <p>To finalize the engagement work, you need to review and finalize the reports that document your findings and present a conclusion, then send those reports to your clients.</p>
        <p>Complete all available checklist documents, such as the <b>Engagement completion checklist</b> or the <b>Reporting checklist</b>.</p>
        <p>Completion checklists help you determine whether sufficient evidence has been obtained to form a conclusion on the financial statements. In a Review engagement, you need to complete the <b>5-125 Review Engagement Completion</b>, where you provide responses to questions about the procedures and engagement quality.</p>
        <p>Completion checklists are typically prepared by the file reviewer and signed off by the partner or practitioner.</p>
        <p>You also need to send the clients any relevant letters that you need them to review, sign and return. For example, if the <b>4-500 Representation Letter (Draft)</b> is available in your engagement, you can review it and send it to your clients using the <b>4-500Q Representation Letter - Query</b> to sign and return.</p>
        <p>Lastly, use the <b>5-300Q Final Documents</b> to send other documents, such as trial balance and financial statements, to the client.</p>
