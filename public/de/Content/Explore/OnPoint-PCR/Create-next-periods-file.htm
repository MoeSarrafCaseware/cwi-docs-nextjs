        <h1>Create next period&apos;s file</h1><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresPCR.flsnp" /><p>You can carry forward an engagement to re-use information and responses from the prior year that have not changed. You can also choose to accept all of last year&apos;s changes or only work on the individual items that have changed.</p>
        <p>To learn about what is carried forward and what&apos;s not carried forward, see <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Carry-forward-an-engagement.htm">Carry forward an engagement</a>.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Responses provided by clients in PBC Request documents are not carried forward.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Open the new engagement (created from carry forward).</p>
                <p>You are presented with carry forward options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Carry forward all documents and files from the original engagement at once (bulk carry forward).</p>
                    </li>

        <p>If you accept the Carry Forward suggestions, responses from last year&apos;s file are carried over to the <b>1-100 Engagement set up</b> document. Once you proceed to <b>1-125 Review Engagement Quality Acceptance and Conclusion</b>, you are again presented with the carry forward suggestions from last year&apos;s file - and so forth for each engagement document.</p>
