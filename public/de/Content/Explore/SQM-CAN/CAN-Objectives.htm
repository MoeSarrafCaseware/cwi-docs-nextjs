        <h1>Objectives</h1>
        <p>In the <b>DESIGN</b> module, the <b>Objectives</b> tab is where the system designer record the firm’s quality objectives and assess their relevance.</p>
        <h2>Define the objective</h2>
        <p>There are 3 types of objectives:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Mandatory objectives</b> - These objectives are prescribed by the firm’s applicable quality management standard. The firm must assess their relevance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Network objectives</b> - These objectives are prescribed by the firm’s network firm, where relevant. The network firm will distribute the prescribed objectives, which are then imported in Settings. The firm must assess their relevance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Firm objectives</b> - These objectives are recorded by the firm and are in addition to the mandatory and network objectives.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Complete an objective</h2>
        <p>To complete the <b>Objectives</b> dialogue, system designers can add a new objective or edit an objective from the list of objectives already included in the table.</p>
        <p>To modify an objective, see <b><a href="#Modify_an_objective">Modify an objective</a></b>.</p>
        <p>
            <h3>To add a new objective:</h3>
