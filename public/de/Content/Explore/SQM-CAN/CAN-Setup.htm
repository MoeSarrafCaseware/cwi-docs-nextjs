        <h1>Setup (Einrichten)</h1>
        <p>In the <b>DESIGN</b> module, the <b>Setup</b> tab is where the system designer selects the firm’s quality management standards and defines the risk assessment.</p>
        <h2>Set the firm’s quality management standards</h2>
        <p>The system designer must select the quality management standard applicable to the firm.</p>
        <p>Note the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If your system is set up as a network firm that distributes a network-wide selection of objectives, risks, policies, procedures, tasks and monitoring activities, then all relevant standards must be selected here.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>At least one standard must be always selected.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To change your firm’s quality management standard, select the applicable standard from the drop-down menu. Make sure you deselect any standard that is not applicable to your firm.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Applicable-standards.png" alt="Applicable standard." /></p>
        <p class="note">To save your selection and close the drop-down menu, select the applicable selected header.</p>
        <h2>Define the risk assessment</h2>
        <p>The system designer can define the risk assessment by setting up the risk matrix and risk thresholds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Risk assessment matrix</b> - The system designer sets the results of the risk assessment process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Risk thresholds</b> - The system designer sets the level of response required for the risk assessment results.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> We recommend that you develop a common set of assessment criteria that will be used to assess the risk level of a quality objective not being achieved. The assessment criteria will be used to determine the appropriate levels of Probability of occurrence and Effect on achievement of objectives.</p>
        <h2>Risk assessment matrix</h2>
        <p>When an end user records and assesses possible quality risks, SQM will automatically assess the <b>Probability of occurrence</b> and the <b>Effect that the risks will have on the achievement of the quality objectives</b> based on the system designer’s defined matrix.</p>
        <p>To define the risk assessment matrix, the system designer must select the appropriate level for each input, ranging from <i>Very low</i> to <i>High</i>, resulting in 25 possible assessed risk results.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/2-risk-assessment.png" alt="Risk assessment matrix." /></p>
        <p>If you modify a risk result, a notification message displays confirming that the change has been made.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/3-risk-level.png" alt="Modify a risk result." /></p>
        <p>
            <h2>Risk thresholds</h2>
        </p>
        <p>Risk thresholds are the responses required for each risk result from the Risk assessment matrix. System designers must set the risk response level.</p>
        <p>There are four risk response levels:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>None</b> - When the risk result is not a quality risk, no response is required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Apply judgment</b> - When the risk result does not always require a response, the end user must determine if a response is required, then decide the appropriate risk response level.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The applied judgment must be documented when recording the risk assessment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Moderate</b> - When the risk result is a quality risk, a moderate response that sufficiently addresses the assessed risk is required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Significant</b> - When the risk result indicates a high quality risk, a significant response that addresses the assessed risk is required.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To define a risk threshold, the system designer must select the appropriate risk response level from the Risk threshold drop-downs.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/4-apply-judgement.png" alt="Define a risk threshold." /></p>
        <p>If you modify a risk threshold, a notification message displays confirming that the change has been made.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/5risk-threshold.png" alt="Modify a risk threshold." /></p>
        <h2>Complete the risk assessment</h2>
        <p>To complete the risk assessment, the system designer must finalize and sign off on the Applicable standards and Risk assessment sections.</p>
        <p>To sign off, select the <b>Sign-off</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-signoff-procedure.png" />). Your initials will appear.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/6-sign-off.png" alt="Sign-off." /></p>
        <p>If you need to modify the <b>Applicable standards</b> or <b>Risk assessment</b> sections, you’ll need to remove the sign-off by selecting your initials.</p>
