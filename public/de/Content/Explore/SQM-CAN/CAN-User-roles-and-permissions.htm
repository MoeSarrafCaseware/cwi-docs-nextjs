        <h1>User roles and permissions</h1>
        <p>Assigned staff and group roles and permissions provide the required Caseware Cloud users access to SQM. The users will have access to specific modules based on the responsibilities that they will have within the firm’s system of quality management.</p>
        <p>
            <h2>Roles and permissions in SQM</h2>
        </p>
        <p>Roles and permissions can be allocated to individual users or to groups of individuals.</p>
        <p>When allocating the roles and permissions to individual users, the access will be granted in <b>Staff</b> while groups of users will be granted access in <b>Groups</b>.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Only individuals with a Settings Admin role in the Caseware Cloud platform are able to set up the staff and group roles and permissions. Ensure you set up the security and staff role permissions for the Caseware Cloud platform prior to setting up the staff and group roles and permissions in SQM.</p>
        <p>There are 5 available roles in SQM:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Create</b> - All users requiring access to the firm’s system of quality management must have the Create access activated. This access allows users to perform various functions within SQM, including creating and submitting tasks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Design</b> - Users involved in designing the firm’s system of quality management require access to the <b>DESIGN</b> module.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Evaluate</b> - The individuals with ultimate responsibility for the firm’s system of quality management will perform evaluations and need access to the <b>EVALUATE</b> module. They may be supported by those operationally responsible for system elements, who will also need access to the <b>EVALUATE</b> module.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Monitor</b> - Users designing and performing monitoring activities need access to the <b>MONITOR</b> module. Those ultimately accountable for the firm’s system of quality management will also need access to the <b>MONITOR</b> module to review monitoring results and remediation processes during system evaluations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Operate overview</b> - Users responsible for monitoring task responses will need access to the <b>OPERATE OVERVIEW</b> module.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
