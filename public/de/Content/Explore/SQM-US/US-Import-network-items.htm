        <h1>Import network items</h1>
        <p>The <b>Network Import</b> setting allows users to import network items, such as prescribed objectives, risks, policy and procedure responses and monitoring activities to a firm’s system of quality management on SQM.</p>
        <h2>Importieren</h2>
        <p>In the <b>Import</b> page menu option, the firm can import the network items into the individual network member firm’s system on SQM.</p>
        <p>These items are imported using a .sqmex format file.</p>
        <p>An .sqmex file is created when the network firm exports the network’s databases of items from its own system of quality management on SQM.</p>
        <p>These include databases of the network’s prescribed objectives, risks, policy responses, procedure responses and monitoring activities.</p>
        <h3>To import:</h3>

        <h2>Download template to record network items</h2>

        <h2>Record individual records manually</h2>

        <p>For example, to record a network prescribed policy response, click on <b>Settings</b> and select <b>SQM | Policy responses</b>.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/5 Record individual records manually.png" alt="The option to record a network prescribed policy response in the Policy responses tab of the Policy responses settings." /></p>
