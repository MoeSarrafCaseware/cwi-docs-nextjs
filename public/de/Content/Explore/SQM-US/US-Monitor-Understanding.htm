        <h1>Understanding</h1>
        <p>In the <b>MONITOR</b> module, the <b>Understanding</b> tab is used to record a thorough understanding of the firm and its system of quality management as part of the preparations for monitoring the firm’s system of quality management.</p>
        <h2>Define understanding</h2>
        <p>The <b>Understanding</b> tab prompts the individual responsible for conducting the monitoring and remediation process to answer questions and document their understanding of the firm’s system of quality management.</p>
        <p>This understanding will assist in determining the nature, timing and extent of the monitoring activities that will be performed.</p>
        <p>The questions are divided into two sections, covering:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Understanding of the firm and its engagements</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Design of the firm’s system of quality management</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
