        <h1>Aufgaben</h1>
        <p>In the <b>OPERATE</b> module, the <b>Tasks</b> tab provides users with an overview of tasks that have already been completed and/or the scheduled tasks which must still be completed.</p>
        <h2>Define tasks</h2>
        <p>There are 2 types of tasks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Automatic tasks</b> - These tasks are automatically generated based on a predefined schedule within the <b>DESIGN</b> module and will automatically appear on the user’s <b>OPERATE TASKS</b> page on predetermined dates.</p>
                <p>Note that the frequency of these tasks is set during the design of the linked procedure response, and the task content is set when designing the task itself.</p>
                <p>Automatic tasks will only be scheduled once the relevant procedure responses and their linked tasks have been approved and published to the OPERATE SoQM.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Manual tasks</b> - These tasks are user-assigned tasks that do not follow a predefined schedule. Users can create new manual tasks when required.</p>
                <p>Note that individual users can only see their own tasks and cannot see the tasks of any other users.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>To add a new manual task:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click on the <b>Add</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/-Add.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />), and select <b>Task</b>.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/1add task.png" alt="Add a Task." /></p>
                <p>A dialog displaying all the available tasks allocated to you will appear.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter a description for the task.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the specific task to be created.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <b>CREATE</b>.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/2click create.png" alt="Click CREATE." /></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The new task is created in SQM and is listed in the table of tasks.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/3 new task.png" alt="The new task is created." /></p>
        <p>While adding the newly created task, a new browser tab is launched, presenting a form. Complete and submit the form to finalize the completion of the task.</p>
        <h2>Delete a manual task</h2>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Manually created tasks can be deleted while their status is marked as <b>In Progress</b>. Once a task has been submitted, it cannot be deleted.</p>
        <h3>To delete a manual task:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Navigate to the task table and click the <b>Delete</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Delete-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />).</p>
                <p>A dialogue will appear to confirm that the task can be deleted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>DELETE</b>.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/4 delete task.png" alt="Delete task." /></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Edit a task</h2>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Tasks can be edited while their status is marked as <b>In Progress</b>. Once a task has already been submitted, the task cannot be edited.</p>
        <h3>To edit a task:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Navigate to the task table and click the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-inline.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />).</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/5 edit a task.png" /></p>
                <p>The task form will open in a new browser.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Complete and submit the form to finish editing the task.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Complete a task form</h2>
        <p>The new browser tab reflects a form that the user must complete and submit before the task can be marked as complete.</p>
        <p>For example, the form may include tasks such as uploading the user’s CPD reflective plan.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/6 Complete a task form.png" alt="Complete a task form." /></p>
        <p>Note that fields marked with a red asterisk (<span style="color: #ff0000;">*</span>) are mandatory and must be completed before you can submit the form.</p>
        <p>Complete the required fields and click <b>SUBMIT</b> to finalize the task.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/7 click submit.png" alt="Click SUBMIT." /></p>
        <p>The form’s status will change to submitted and the tab can be closed.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/8 forms status changed to submitted.png" alt="Form status changed to Submitted. " /></p>
        <p>Once the tab is closed, SQM will display the status as submitted.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/9 sqm status display as submitted.png" alt="Form status displayed as Submitted." /></p>
