        <h1>Policy responses</h1>
        <p>In the <b>DESIGN</b> module, the <b>Policy response</b> tab is where system designers document the firm’s policy responses, outlining how the firm will respond to quality risks.</p>
        <h2>Define policy responses</h2>
        <p>There are 3 types of policy responses:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Mandatory policy responses</b> - These policy responses are prescribed by the firm’s applicable quality management standard. The firm must assess their relevance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Network policy responses</b> - These policy responses are prescribed by the firm’s network firm, where relevant. The network firm will distribute the prescribed policy responses, which are then imported in Settings. The firm must assess their relevance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Firm policy responses</b> - These policy responses are recorded by the firm and are in addition to the mandatory and network policy responses.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Modify_a_policy_response"></a>Modify a policy response</h2>
        <p>Note that existing policy responses can only be modified if the status is in <b>Draft</b> mode. If a policy response has already been accepted or reviewed, the sign-off must be removed before the policy response can be modified.</p>
        <p>
            <h3>To edit a policy response:</h3>
        </p>

            <h3>To delete a policy response:</h3>
        </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Mandatory and network policy responses cannot be deleted.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click on the <b>Expand</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/expand-.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) under the <b>Relevant</b> column to expand the policy response.</p>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If the policy response does not apply to a firm, it will be marked as <b>Not relevant</b>. Non relevant policy responses are not carried forward in the firm’s design of the system of quality management.</p>
        <h2>Sign-offs and approvals</h2>
        <p>Policy responses selected as relevant and signed off as prepared will be considered finalized and included in the draft system of quality management. Once the firm approves the drafts, they will be published.</p>

        <h2>Complete policy response</h2>
        <p>To complete the <b>Policy response</b> dialogue, system designers can add a new policy response or modify a policy response from the list of policy responses already included in the table. To modify a policy response, see <a href="#Modify_a_policy_response"><b>Modify a policy response</b></a>.</p>
