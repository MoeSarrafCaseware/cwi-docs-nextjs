        <h2>Financial statement area checklists</h2>
        <p>To enhance the overall workflow experience, additional instructions have been added to procedures in the financial statement area checklists. The instructions include prerequisites, reference information and links to relevant documents to help you complete the checklists.</p>
        <h2>Statement of Income and Retained earnings</h2>
        <p>If you select <i>Yes</i> to the <i>Would you like to combine retained earnings with the statement of income/loss</i> procedure in the <b>109 Financial statements optimiser</b> document, the name of the statement now displays as “Statement of Income and Retained earnings” in the <b>110 Financial statements</b> document. Previously, the statement was named “Combined Statement of Income and Retained earnings”.</p>
        <h2>Hide sub-level headings for notes in financial statements</h2>
        <p>In the <b>110 Financial statements</b> document, the <b>Notes Print Settings</b> now include an option to automatically hide sub-level headings for notes in the PDF output if there are no subsequent notes in that group.</p>

        <p>Balance discrepancy checks in the <b>6-20 Financial statements</b> document now compares the absolute values for the labeled rows.
