        <h1>What&apos;s new - Caseware Audit Winter 2020 (v2.967.0)</h1>
        <p>Here is a listing of what&apos;s new for the Caseware Audit Winter 2020 release.</p>
        <h2>Consolidation enabled</h2>
        <p>Use consolidation to combine several entities into one engagement file (the parent company) to publish consolidated financial statements.</p>
        <p>See <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Create-a-consolidation-engagement.htm">Create a consolidation engagement</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2>Financial groups mapping added to optimiser</h2>
        <p>Certain account groups are now not visible by default on the <b>Data</b> page, for example, Farming related groups.</p>
        <p>With this release, you can select distinct groups that may be applicable to your engagement from the <b>Mapping</b> procedure in the <b>Planning Optimiser</b>.</p>
        <p>When you select a mapping group from the procedure, financial groups associated with that industry become visible in the <b>Data</b> page.</p>
        <h2>Simple Electronic Signature</h2>
        <p>To support scenarios where clients are required to sign documents or accept certain terms during the engagement, <b>Simple Electronic Signature</b> is now available in queries.</p>
        <p><b>Simple Electronic Signature</b> provides a paperless, secure and more efficient method for signing documents. Once you send the query to clients, they can sign the document or agree to terms with a single tap or button click.</p>
        <p>Once clients accept the document, a signature log is generated and available for download. The log includes the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Query question details</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signer name and email</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signer location (if the clients have chosen to enable location access)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signer IP Address</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signature date</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Document name</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Document MD5 hash</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Dynamic reassignment</h2>
        <p>Instead of showing a credit balance on the asset side of the <b>Data</b> page, or a debit balance on the liability side, our &quot;flips&quot; function automatically moves the corresponding amount to the appropriate section. You can override this on the <b>Data</b> page or reverse the override as required.</p>
        <h2>Notes library updated</h2>
        <p>The content of the <b>Notes</b> library has been updated with new content. This update includes tailoring procedures to help users include or exclude these notes in <b>Financial Statements</b>.</p>
        <h2>Checklist sign-off warning</h2>
        <p>Now, if you attempt to sign-off on a document that has procedures that are not signed-off, a warning appears.</p>
        <h2>General Improvements</h2>
        <p>The following general improvements have been added for this release.</p>
        <h3>Increased file upload size limit</h3>
        <p>You can now upload up to 500MB files to the engagement. Note that this size limit is per file.</p>
        <h3>Rearranging documents in bulk print</h3>
        <p>You can now drag-and-drop documents in the bulk print set to rearrange them, so they print in the order you desire.</p>
        <p>Note that you can only rearrange documents in groups you define, not in groups predefined by the firm authors or primary authors.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../Interface/CaseWareCloud-SE/Manage-the-engagement-documents-old-layout.htm#Set">Set up bulk print</a>.</p>
        <h3>Expand all / collapse all in checklists</h3>
        <p>You can now expand or collapse all procedure groups in a checklist document. A new <b>Expand All</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/expand-all-checklist-1.png" />) / <b>Collapse All</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/collapse-all-checklist-1.png" />) is available so you can easily and quickly scan the document.</p>
        <h3>New query layout in the engagement archive</h3>
        <p>The engagement reference copy output now displays the new query layout.</p>
        <h3>Checklisten</h3>
        <p>If signoff is enabled for procedures and conclusion, a warning message now displays if users attempt to sign off on the document while:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>One or more visible procedures have not been signed off</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>Conclusion</b> section has not been signed off</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Visible procedures in the <b>Conclusion</b> section have not been signed off</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Risks module</h3>
        <p>Risk assessments can now be carried forward.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/carry-forward-risk-assessments.PNG" /></p>
        <h3>Signoff</h3>
        <p>The logic for preparer and reviewer signoff has been enhanced. Users can now only remove their own signoffs.</p>
        <p>A user that has been granted one or more administrator security roles can remove signoffs by other users.</p>
        <p>Administrator security roles in Caseware Cloud are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Administrator</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Settings Admin</p>
            </li>

        </ul>
