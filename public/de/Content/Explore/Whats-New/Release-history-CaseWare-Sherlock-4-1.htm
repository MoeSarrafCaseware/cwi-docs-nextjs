        <h2>Entity level security</h2>
        <p>Access to entity data is now restricted to users with the <a href="../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Grant-users-and-groups-access-to-entities.htm">Viewer permission</a> for the entity. When a user opens a Sherlock application, the entities available to them are automatically filtered to display only those that they can access.</p>
