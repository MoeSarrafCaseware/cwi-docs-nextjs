        <h1>What&apos;s new - Cloud 31.2</h1>
        <p>Caseware Cloud 31.2 enhances your firm’s security with ADFS single sign-on integration, permission updates and more.</p>
        <h2>Single sign-on integration with ADFS</h2>
        <p>Caseware Cloud now supports single sign-on (SSO) integration with Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). Integration with ADFS simplifies the staff login process and improves security. To get started, see <a href="../../Setup/Environments-and-Configuration/Integrate-single-sign-on-with-ADFS.htm">Integrate single sign-on with ADFS</a>.</p>
        <h2>Separate staff and contact group permissions</h2>
        <p>We’ve split the permission for staff and contact groups to provide greater control over these areas. Users with the Staff Admin role now manage staff groups, while users with the Entities Admin role now manage contact groups. If you still require the previous functionality of these roles, you can create a custom role with both permissions.</p>
        <h2>Alternative Share permission</h2>
        <p>We’ve added an alternative Share permission to provide greater control over security in your Cloud site. This new Share permission (labeled S) restricts users from sharing entities or entity content that they themselves cannot access. The existing Share permission (relabeled to A) allows users to share all available entity or entity content permissions to themselves and other users, even if it would grant them a higher level of access than they currently possess. For more information and best practices, see <a href="../../Setup/Security/Create-custom-security-roles.htm">Create custom security roles</a>.</p>
        <h2>Multiple attachments in Other Engagements</h2>
        <p>You can now attach multiple documents to Other Engagements. This enables firms to use Caseware Cloud to track and manage a greater variety of engagements.</p>
        <h2>General enhancements and fixes</h2>
        <p>In addition to the latest features, Caseware Cloud 31.2 includes various enhancements and bug fixes to improve your overall workflow.</p>
