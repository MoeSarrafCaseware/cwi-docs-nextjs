        <h1>Whats new - Cloud 35.0</h1>
        <p>Find out what’s new in Caseware Cloud 35.0.</p>
        <h2>License renewal period</h2>
        <p>Administrators can now view the renewal period for all of their firm’s active licenses on the <b>Firm Settings | System | Cloud Billing</b> page.</p>
        <h2>Read-only licenses</h2>
        <p>Staff can now be assigned read-only licenses to Cloud engagement apps. Read-only licenses allow users to view engagement content within an app, without consuming a paid app license. To assign a user a read-only license, navigate to their user profile, and on the <b>Apps</b> tab, select <b>Read-only</b> for the relevant app.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="../../Setup/Security/Enable-Cloud-apps.htm">Manage access for Caseware Cloud apps</a>.</p>
        <h2>Deprecation of the Replace function</h2>
        <p>Based on feedback from clients and overall low usage in the last year, we have decided to deprecate the <b>Replace</b> function for Working Papers files. This deprecation will have no impact on the <b>Replace Server Copy</b> feature in Working Papers, which is still available. Going forward, you can replace a Working Papers file by simply deleting the Cloud copy, then uploading the new copy from your local computer.</p>
