        <h1>What&apos;s new in Caseware Cloud Engagements 2024-08</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Caseware Cloud Engagements 2024-08 release! This release introduces calculated adjustments and the ability to search for financial groups in the <b>Data</b> page.</p>
        <p>To learn more about the Caseware Cloud Engagements platform, see <a href="../Cloud-Apps/Caseware-Cloud-Engagements.htm">What is Caseware Cloud Engagements?</a></p>
        <h2>Calculated adjustments</h2>
        <p>You now have the ability to create calculated adjustments. When you add an account or group line to an adjustment, you now have the option to select <b>fx</b> in the <b>Amount</b> field and create a calculation to determine the adjustment amount.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/NewCalculatedAdjustment.png" alt="Create a calculated adjustment." /></p>
        <p>Similarly to custom calculations in dynamic tables, you can reference trial balance data in the calculation. If the value of the referenced trial balance account or group is changed, a <b>Recalculate</b> button appears for the adjustment on the <b>Adjustments</b> page. You can select this button to recalculate and update the adjustment amount.</p>
        <p>If more than one adjustment requires recalculation, you can also select the <b>Recalculate all</b> button at the top of the page to recalculate all adjustments at once.</p>

        <h2>Search for financial groups on the Data page</h2>
        <p>To allow you to more easily find financial groups, a search option is now available on the <b>Financial groups</b> tabs on the <b>Data</b> page.</p>
