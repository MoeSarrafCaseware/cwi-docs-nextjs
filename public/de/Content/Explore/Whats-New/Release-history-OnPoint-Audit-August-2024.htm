            <li>Cloud Connector formulas now support using parent entity, subsidiary, and consolidated data for consolidation engagements.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Planningbalances"></a>Planning balances</h2>
        <p>OnPoint Audit now supports planning balances, which allow you to record and track interim balances before the year end.</p>
        <p>You can upload a planning balance for the current or prior years on the <b>Data</b> page by selecting the <b>Import</b> tab, then <b>Excel or CSV | Planning Trial Balance</b>.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/planning-balances-01.png" alt="The Planning Trial Balance option when importing data from a Excel or CSV file." /></p>
        <p>Where applicable, select from the new <b>Planning</b> column headers to indicate planning balances.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/planning-balances-02.png" alt="The trial balance data to import with a column heading expanded to show a variety of options, including new &apos;Planning&apos; options." /></p>
        <p>When the import is complete, you can easily compare the changes between your uploaded planning balances and the final balances on the <b>Accounts</b> tab.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/planning-balances-03.png" alt="The imported trial balance on the Accounts tab, with columns for Planning balances." /></p>
        <p>You can also use planning balances:</p>

                <p>When viewing analysis charts.</p>
            </li>

                <p>In Excel documents by linking balance values using Caseware Cloud Connector.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bitte beachten Sie:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Visibility conditions and dynamic text with Trial Balance conditions are evaluated based on the planning balance until the final balance is imported.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The financial statements document currently does not currently support planning balances.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can only import planning balances from an Excel or CSV file and if your engagement has an annual reporting period.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Bulk"></a>Bulk actions for documents</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Documents</strong> page now features the option to make changes to multiple documents at once.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/BulkDocuments.png" alt="Enabling Bulk actions option on a documents in an engagement." /></p>
        <p>When you turn on the <strong>Bulk actions</strong> option from the <strong>More actions</strong> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/more-actions-inline.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) menu on the <strong>Documents</strong> page, you can select multiple documents and then move, delete or sign off on all of those documents at once.</p>
        <p><strong>Document permissions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firm authors:</strong> Can&apos;t delete documents available in the app by default.</li>
            <li><strong>End users:</strong> Can&apos;t delete documents available in the app by default or those created by firm authors.</li>
            <li><strong>Bulk Sign-off:</strong> This option is only available within engagements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/SelectingDocstoDelete.png" alt="Selecting documents to bulk delete." /></p>
        <p>If you try to delete documents without permission, a confirmation dialog will list the documents you can&apos;t delete.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/DeletionPermissionsError.png" alt="Error that appears if you do not have permissions to bulk delete documents. " /></p>
        <p>During bulk sign-off, you can review documents before finalizing. The <strong>Review</strong> dialog displays a <strong>Status</strong> column highlighting any important information you should be aware of.</p>
        <p>For instance, if you&apos;re signing off on a checklist, the <strong>Status</strong> column will indicate if any procedures still need to be signed off on. Similarly, the dialog will alert you if you&apos;ve selected any documents that cannot be signed off on at this time.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/AlertDocumentsCannotBeSignedOff.png" alt="Alert appears when documents cannot be signed off on due to lack of permissions." /></p>
        <p>When you have completed the actions you want to take you can turn off <b>Bulk actions</b> from the <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/more-actions-inline.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt="" />) menu or select the <b>Close</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/CloseIcon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt="" />) icon.</p>

        <h2>Risk Library design updates</h2>
        <p>Several changes have been made to the design of the <strong>Risk Library</strong> page to improve usability, including</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>VIEW BY</strong> filter is now set to <strong>Indicators</strong> by default. The <strong>Categories</strong> option for the filter has been renamed to <strong>Cycles</strong> or <strong>Areas</strong> depending on whether cycles or areas are used in the risk library. If indicators are not used in the risk library, the risks are displayed by cycles or areas instead.</li>
            <li>Collapsed risk cards now display any assertions applied to the risk as well as the cycle or area associated with the risk, if applicable.</li>
            <li>The number indicator for risk groups is now larger and displays next to the group name instead of on the far right side of the screen.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Category</strong> dropdown is now the <strong>Cycles</strong> or <strong>Areas</strong> dropdown depending on whether cycles or areas are used in the risk library. Risk groups are displayed in the dropdown as subcategories of the cycles or areas they’re associated with.</li>
            <li>A <strong>Cycles</strong> filter is now available so you can filter risks by cycle.</li>
            <li>You can now collapse and expand all cycles or all risk groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hide zero balance columns in dynamic tables</h2>
        <p>You can now set dynamic table columns to hide automatically if the column contains only zero balances from the table settings.</p>
        <p>When you create a new dynamic table in a template or engagement, the <strong>Hide zero balance columns</strong> setting is turned on by default. The setting is turned off for any existing dynamic tables created before this release.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Hide-zero-balance-option.png" alt="Hide zero balance columns option in the Visibility settings." /></p>
        <h2>Customize headings in financial statements</h2>
        <p>The following updates have been made to give you more customization options for headings in financial statements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Formatting Options dialog now includes a field to set the font size for area titles.</li>
            <li>You can now add numbering for area titles in the Numbering Heading Options dialog. While previously the numbering was only displayed in the Document Map, it is now also displayed when you navigate to the area in the financial statements as well as in the table of contents</li>
            <li>All five heading levels for areas and notes can now be displayed in the table of contents.</li>
            <li>You can now hide individual headings for areas and notes from the table of contents as well as hide the numbering for an individual heading from the <strong>More actions</strong> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/more-actions-inline.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt="" />) menu for an area or note.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Page numbering settings for financial statements</h2>
        <p>The print settings for financial statement areas now include a <strong>Page Numbering</strong> section. You can choose whether to continue the page numbering from the previous area or restart the numbering.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/PageNumbering-FS.png" alt="Page numbering settings for financial statements" /></p>
        <h2>Design update for the Product Settings dialog</h2>
        <p>This release features a brand new design for the Product Settings dialog to provide a consistent look and feel across each tab of the dialog.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/ProductSettingsdialog.png" alt="Design update for the Product settings dialog" /></p>
        <p>Dimensions now have a <strong>Number</strong> field so you can define a unique identifier for each dimension. This unique identifier can be used as a field when importing transactions to assign transactions to a dimension.</p>
        <p>If you do not want to use dimension numbers, you can turn the <strong>View numbers</strong> option off and hide the <strong>Number</strong> column.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Dimensions.png" alt="Specifying dimension identifiers on the Product settings dialog." /></p>
        <h2>Sync trial balance across engagements</h2>
        <p>During data import, a new option called <strong>Sync Trial Balance</strong> lets you automatically link data from another engagement. Any changes you make to the source data will be reflected in the synced engagement, keeping everything up-to-date.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/SyncTrialBalance.png" alt="Sync Trial Balance option" /></p>
        <p>When engagement data is synced from another engagement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A link to the source engagement is displayed on the <strong>Data</strong> page.</li>
            <li>You cannot edit accounts, groups or adjustments synced from the source engagement.</li>
            <li>You cannot assign accounts that have been synced from the source engagement.</li>
            <li>You can create issues and annotations for synced accounts and groups but cannot create annotations for synced adjustments.</li>
            <li>When changes are made to the source engagement, users in the destination engagement receive a notification to inform them that those changes have been applied to their file. Engagements are resynced every five minutes.</li>
            <li>If you lock down an engagement that contains data synced from a source engagement, changes made in the source engagement are no longer synced.</li>
            <li>If both the source and destination engagement are carried forward, the carried forward files are automatically linked so you can continue to sync data from the current year&apos;s source engagement.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Financial"></a>Financial groups on the Data page</h2>
        <p>When you access the financial groups tabs of the <strong>Data</strong> page, you can now</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reorder groups</li>
            <li>Expand and collapse groups</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Add accounts for internal subsidiaries</h2>
        <p>In consolidation engagements, you can now manually add and edit accounts for internal subsidiaries.</p>
        <h2>Carry forward for adjustments</h2>
        <p>You can now edit and delete prior year adjustments in engagements created from carry forward.</p>
        <h2><a name="Link"></a>Link annotations to checklist procedures</h2>
        <p>You can now link annotations to specific checklist procedures instead of the checklist document as a whole. You can select a specific procedure after they select a checklist document from the <strong>Link</strong> dropdown. They can expand and collapse groups and procedures with subprocedures to find the procedure they’re looking for. The selected procedure is displayed in blue.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/LinkAnnotations.png" alt="Linking annotations to procedures." /></p>
        <h2>Edit planning balances on the Data page</h2>
        <p>You can now edit planning balances on the <strong>Data</strong> page even after the final balance has been imported.</p>
        <h2>Select multiple dimensions when posting adjustments</h2>
        <p>When you post adjustments to groups, you can now select multiple dimensions for each group line in the adjustment.</p>
