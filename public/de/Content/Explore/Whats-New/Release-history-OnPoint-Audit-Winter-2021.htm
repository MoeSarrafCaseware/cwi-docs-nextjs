        <h2>Non-departmental Income Statements</h2>
        <p>OnPoint Audit financial statements now include the ability to generate non-departmental income statements. Non-departmental income statements provide the flexibility to create income statements which present all operating expenditures in a single section instead of departmental breakdowns.</p>
        <p>Firm authors can now add financial groups to existing grouping structures in the firm template. Note that firm authors can’t modify or delete any groups added by primary authors. To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Add-edit-and-delete-groups.htm">Customize financial groups</a> and <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Group-properties.htm">Group properties</a>.</p>
        <p>If custom financial groupings have been created, the user can manually add the custom groupings to the non-departmental income statement. The added custom groupings in the income statement are retained when you carry forward the engagement and follow the same financial statement set-up procedures.</p>
        <p>To learn how to add custom groupings to the financial statements, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Edit-table-rows-in-the-financial-statements.htm">Edit table rows in the financial statements</a>.</p>
        <p>
            <h2>Additional improvements</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Custom widths for dynamic tables</h3>
        </p>
        <p>You can now set custom widths for dynamic table columns from the column settings. Once you select Specific from the Width drop-down, you can specify the width of the column in inches or centimeters. The unit of measurement is determined by the unit selected in the product settings.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Edit-table-columns-in-the-financial-statements.htm">Column settings in dynamic tables</a>.</p>
        <h3>Dynamic table font size</h3>
        <p>You can now modify the font size of text in dynamic tables by selecting <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions.png"></img>). You can use this option to decrease the font size when working with large tables to fit more content on a single page. The default font size is 11.25pt.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Change-the-dynamic-table-font-size.htm">Change the dynamic table font size</a>.</p>
        <h3>Default underline and overline options for dynamic tables</h3>
        <p>To enhance the presentation of the financial statements, you can now set default underline and overline options for dynamic tables in the Table borders settings.</p>
        <p>You can set underline and overline options for header rows, total rows, grand total rows and final rows.</p>
        <p>You can also select the Override table customization checkbox to override existing underline and overline options in all tables and apply the default settings.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Set-default-underline-and-overline-options-for-dynamic-tables.htm">Set default underline and overline options for dynamic tables</a>.</p>
        <p>
            <h3>Default behavior for rows overridden or rounded to zero</h3>
        </p>
        <p>When you manually override trial balance values to zero or when trial balance values are rounded to zero, the dynamic table row now displays in gray in the financial statements. This will not be included in the print copy.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Accounts-and-Analysis/Review-group-and-account-balances-in-the-financial-statements.htm">Review group and account balances in the financial statements</a>.</p>
        <p>
            <h3>Dynamic text in financial statement area print settings</h3>
        </p>
        <p>Firm authors can now add dynamic text to headers and footers for financial statement areas in the print settings.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Add-a-header-or-footer-in-the-financial-statements.htm">Add a header or a footer in the financial statements</a>.</p>
        <h3>Hide sub-level headings for notes in financial statements</h3>
        <p>In the <b>7-600 Financial statements</b> document, the Notes print settings now include an option to automatically hide sub-level headings for notes in the PDF output if there are no subsequent notes in that group.</p>
        <p>The option to hide sub-level headings in the PDF output is also available for individual notes in the <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions.png"></img>) menu if there are no subsequent notes in that group.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Set-up-the-print-options-in-the-financial-statements.htm">Set up the print options in the financial statements</a> and <a href="../../Engagements/Statements-and-Conclusions/Hide-sub-level-headings-for-notes.htm">Hide sub-level headings for notes</a>.</p>
