        <h1>What&apos;s new - OnPoint PCR 20.7.37</h1>
        <p>Here is a listing of what&apos;s new for version <b>20.7.37</b> of OnPoint PCR.</p>
        <h2>Content updates</h2>
        <h3>Trial balance financial grouping structure</h3>
        <p>The trial balance financial grouping structure has been revised to support more robust financial reporting and to address new financial statement accounting and reporting requirements and standards. For example, groups were added to address new Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) related to revenue from contracts with customers and leases. New groups were also added to support accounting for activities related to construction contractors.</p>
        <h3>Revision of financial statements</h3>
        <p>The financial statements have been revised and expanded to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Incorporate new groups added to the trial balance financial grouping structure</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Provide additional flexibility in reporting (e.g., net of tax or gross presentation of other comprehensive income, portrait or landscape presentation of the statement of stockholders&apos; equity, changing the titles of financial statements)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Allow for more customization of the statement of cash flows</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add statement of cash flows worksheets to aid in the preparation of the statement of cash flows</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add illustrative note disclosures. The new notes address the summary of significant accounting policies; cash and cash equivalents; accounts receivable; and property, plant, and equipment and may be easily copied or tailored. The list of note disclosures will be expanded in future releases.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>GAAP presentation and disclosure checklist</h3>
        <p>The checklist has been revised to include additional presentation and disclosure requirements and guidance from recently issued, or soon to be effective, FASB Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs), including those that permit early adoption.</p>
        <h3>Analysis graphs</h3>
        <p>The fieldwork documents for review engagements include revised analysis charts, graphs, and ratios to support improved analytical procedures and to incorporate changes to the trial balance financial grouping structure.</p>
        <h2>The Data page</h2>
        <p>The Data page is a redesign of the former Trial Balance page. The purpose of the redesign is to provide flexible reporting methods, support more data sources and parameters, provide a guided workflow for import and mapping as well as improve performance and usability. New features include a redesigned group and accounts view, a left pane to easily switch views, improved export and the ability to sign off on the trial balance and adjustments.</p>
