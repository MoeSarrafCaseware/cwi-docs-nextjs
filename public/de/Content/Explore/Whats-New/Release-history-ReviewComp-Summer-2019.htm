        <h1>What&apos;s new - Caseware ReviewComp Summer 2019</h1>
        <p>Here is a listing of what&apos;s new for the <b>Summer 2019</b> release of Caseware ReviewComp.</p>
        <h2>Adding a firm logo</h2>
        <p>Your firm logo is now linked to the engagement. Once you upload the logo in Cloud, it automatically displays in the designated logo placeholders in letters and in the Notice to the Reader and Independent practitioners report sections in the financial statements document.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Add-a-firm-logo-and-letterhead.htm">Add a firm logo and letterhead. </a></p>
        <h2>Financial statements notes</h2>
        <p>We have introduced a second subcategory in the notes to the financial statements to improve browsing, scannability and readability. For example, revenue recognition is now broken down to 8 subcategories, whereas previously, it included one long text section.</p>
        <h2>Zusammenfassung der falschen Darstellungen</h2>
        <p>The <b>4-10-1 Worksheet - Accumulation of identified misstatements - identification</b> document now includes a bar graph to visually represent the adjusting entries.</p>
        <p>The graph shows the five main categories (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenues and Expenses) and the available adjustments. You can select which adjustment types to display on the graph.</p>
        <p>In the example below, we have toggled <b>Proposed - Factual adjustments</b> and <b>All Corrected</b> to only view these types of entries on the graph.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/4-10-1.PNG" alt="Proposed - Factual and All Corrected adjustements only are enabled in this graph" /></p>
        <h2>Fixes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Fixed the Preview option in the Notes library. You can now view a preview of a note before you add it in the financial statements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Trial balance group numbers no longer display next to the group name.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Known issues</h2>
        <p>3-02 Assets is incorrectly showing the wrong analysis chart.</p>
