        <p>Here is a listing of what&apos;s new for the Caseware ReviewComp Winter 2021 release.</p>
        <h2>Update to the AAII tax calculation</h2>
        <p>In accordance with the CRA legislation, ReviewComp now includes the updated Adjusted Aggregate Investment Income (AAII) calculation. For Canadian controlled private corporations with tax years after 2018, the small business deduction is now determined by AAII.</p>
        <h2>Netfiling Canadian foreign reporting tax returns</h2>
        <p>Caseware ReviewComp corporate tax certification updates now include netfiling Canadian foreign reporting tax returns (T1134, T1135, T106) for corporations with year-end dates up to May 31, 2022.</p>
        <h2>Update to Basis of Accounting note as per CSRS 4200</h2>
        <p>In the Notes Library, the Basis of Accounting note that is now required under the new CSRS 4200 standards has been removed from the <b>General</b> category and is now listed as its own <b>Basis of Accounting</b> category.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/RCT-BOA-note-library.png" alt="Basis of Accounting category." /></p>
