        <p>Here is a listing of what&apos;s new for the Caseware ReviewComp Winter 2022 release.</p>
        <h2>Enhancements to the Basis of accounting note</h2>
        <p>A new <b>Recognition and measurement</b> note has been added to the required Basis of accounting note in Compilation engagements. The Basis of accounting note has also been enhanced to help you identify the disclosures that apply to your engagement. When you select the Basis of accounting note from the Notes Library, you can now choose from a variety of categories.</p>

        <h2>Formatting updates to Part B Review procedures</h2>
        <p>In Review engagement work programs, the <b>Part B - Additional procedures (optional)</b> section no longer displays additional review procedures by default. Instead, you can select the applicable procedures from the drop-down.</p>
