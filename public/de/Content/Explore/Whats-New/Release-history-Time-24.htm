        <h1 id="time24">What&apos;s new - CasewareCloud Time 24.0</h1>
        <p>Here is a listing of what&apos;s new for version <b>24.0</b> of CasewareCloud Time.</p>
        <h2 id="time-license">Time license management</h2>
        <p>You can now grant access to the Time app and its tools on the <b>Apps</b> tab in the Create and Edit staff dialogs. This makes it easier to manage Time app access, bringing it in line with other Cloud apps that require licenses. The permissions for Time and Expense that were under <b>Security | Role Permissions</b> on the Firm Settings page have been removed.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/staff-add-staff-apps-time-en-957x822.png" alt="The Time app is now managed in the same way as other apps that require a license. Roles can be granted on an individual basis, or to a group." /></p>
        <p>You can now see when a staff member&apos;s Time license status is <b>Unpaid</b> in the App section of their profile, making it easier for you to manage your Time licenses.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/staff-unpaid-app-630x54.png" alt="Unpaid status is indicated by a label on the staff member&apos;s profile page." /></p>
        <h2 id="transfer-time-and-expense">Transfer time and expense entries</h2>
        <p>You can now transfer time and expense entries between entities. This enables you to consolidate time and expense entries when you need to delete an entity, or move entries that were added to the wrong entity by accident. Entries can be moved to another entity, or a specific engagement associated with that entity. To learn more, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Practice/Management/Tracking-staff-work-during-the-engagement.htm#Transfer">Transfer time or expense entries</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/entities-transfer-time-and-expenses-en-821x629.png" alt="You can transfer entries from one entity to another, or to a specific engagement." /></p>
        <h2 id="improved-invoice">Improved invoice customization</h2>
        <p>You can now add multiple line items to invoices. Invoice line items can be created using pre-existing work codes and billing codes, or by entering a custom line item. To learn more about sending an invoice to a client, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Practice/Time-and-Billing/Send-an-invoice-to-a-client.htm">Send an invoice to a client</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/firm-settings-time-templates-preview-en-804x404.png" alt="Clarify billing for clients by adding custom line items to your invoices." /></p>
        <h2 id="office-365">Office 365 calender integration</h2>
        <p>You can now integrate Time with Office 365 to generate pending entries based on events in your Outlook calendar. To learn more, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Setup/Environments-and-Configuration/Integrate-productivity-tools-with-Cloud-(Google-Sharepoint-OneDrive).htm#Integrat">Integrate Office 365</MadCap:xref>.</p>
