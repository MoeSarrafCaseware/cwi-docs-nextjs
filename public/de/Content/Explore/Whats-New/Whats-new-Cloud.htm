        <h2>Prior engagements</h2>
        <p>We’ve heard from many of you that you rarely access older engagements, so with that knowledge, we’ve added a new setting that will accelerate page load times and file searches in Caseware Cloud. This new setting lets you specify when to label engagements as ‘Prior engagements’ after a defined period elapses past the year-end date.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/prior-engagements-setting.png" alt="The Prior Engagement Rules page in the firm settings." /></p>
        <p>Once enabled, staff will only see the list of active engagements, but they can easily toggle between active and prior using the option at the top of the file list.</p>
