        <p>As a manager or a partner, you need a way to track the progress made by your organization. You may need to look at your organization as a whole, or you may want to manage a specific client engagement. If your organization uses tasks in Cloud to track engagement deliverables, you can assign due dates to them. With these due dates assigned, you can review the progress of your organization&apos;s work from the Activities page.</p>
        <h2 id="set-due-dates">Setting due dates on tasks</h2>
        <p>When you set due dates for the activities on Cloud, other staff can track and manage their workloads and deadlines more easily.</p>
        <p><b>To set a due date for a task:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Editor</i> role or equivalent permissions for the client entity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Activities</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the Activities menu, then choose <b>Tasks</b>.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the Tasks page, select the task to be assigned a due date. In the details pane, select <b>Edit</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/edit-icon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />).</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/task-set-due-date-2-630x475.png" style="border:1px solid #3f66a3" alt="Select the Edit icon to add a due date to this task." /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Edit Task dialog, select a due date using the calendar menu.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/task-set-due-date-3-630x373.png" alt="Choose a due date in the calendar box." /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Save</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have now set a due date for the task in Cloud.</p>
        <h2 id="review-assigned-tasks">Reviewing assigned tasks</h2>
        <p>If your organization uses tasks in Cloud for engagement milestones, you can quickly review the tasks for a client to measure the relative engagement progress.</p>
        <p><b>To review assigned tasks:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Viewer</i> role or equivalent permissions for the client entity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select your client entity in the entity selector at the top left side of the page.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/select-entity-630x272.png" style="border:1px solid #3f66a3" alt="Select your client entity to filter Cloud. You will only see content that falls under this entity." /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Activities</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the Activities menu, then choose <b>Tasks</b>.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/task-set-due-date-1-630x357.png" alt="Open the Tasks list." /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <b>Due</b> column heading to sort the tasks by due date.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/tasks-sort-due-date-630x265.png" style="border:1px solid #3f66a3" alt="You can select any column heading to sort the task list by that column." /></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You are now looking at a list of all the tasks related to your engagement. The list is sorted by due date in ascending order, so the earliest tasks are displayed at the top of the list.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/tasks-due-date-review-630x404.png" style="border:1px solid #3f66a3" alt="The tasks with the earliest due dates are at the top of the list. The first two tasks are complete, but the third and fourth tasks are overdue." /></p>
        <p>If an open task has a due date that has already passed, its status and due date are both displayed in red.</p>
        <h2 id="review-overdue-tasks">Viewing overdue tasks</h2>
        <p>Alternatively, you can look up all overdue tasks for all of your clients across your organization.</p>
        <p><b>To view overdue tasks:</b></p>

            <li>

                <p>Select the filter icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/filter-button-16x14.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) in the search bar, and on the filter menu choose <b>Due | Overdue</b>.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/tasks-filter-overdue-630x354.png" style="border:1px solid #3f66a3" alt="Filter the list to only display tasks that are overdue." /></p>
