        <h1>Review engagement costs</h1><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresTime.flsnp" /><p>If your organization uses the Time app to track time and expense entries, you review your organization&apos;s costs and billing in Cloud. Using the Time and Billing apps, you can view summary information about your organization&apos;s overall costs and invoices on Cloud.</p>
        <p>You can also generate reports that give records of some of the costs of your engagement work using the Analysis app to provide short-term forecasts for your engagements or for your organization. When forecasting, you may consider both quantitative and qualitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, you will likely need to review historical data, and some of that data can be pulled directly from Cloud.</p>
        <h2 id="view-cost-billing-summary">View cost and billing summaries</h2>
        <p>You can use some of the summary sections in the Time and Expense apps to review high-level information about your organization&apos;s profitability.</p>

        <h2 id="generate-time-report">Generate a Time and Expense report</h2>
        <p>When you are reviewing the summary information from Time, you may want more detailed information about the costs your organization incurred. You can generate summary reports for your time entries and your expenses to review these costs. For example, if you wanted to review all of the time entries for one of last year&apos;s engagements for a specific client or to track profitability of your firm.</p>
        <p>You can generate a summary report with the following parameters:</p>

        <h2>Generate an Invoice report</h2>
        <p>A simple way to measure your organization&apos;s profitability is to generate a list of invoices for a given period of time. For example, if you wanted to know how much your organization invoiced in the last month, you could generate a report to find out.</p>

        <h2>Generate a Billing report</h2>
        <p>The Billing report enables you to compare the amount billed to clients with the number of staff hours worked by calculating two rates: the billing rate and the effective rate.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Billing rate</b> - The staff rate assigned to the person in Settings. This rate ignores any write up/down amounts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Effective rate</b> - The actual rate after all write up/down amounts are factored in to the staff rate.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This report can be filtered by staff or by client.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Expense entries and personal allocation are not included in the calculation of any rates.</p>
        <p>In practice, the two rates should closely match one another. This indicates that the amount you expected to bill (the billing rate) matches the amount actually billed (the effective rate). An effective rate that consistently differs may indicate a problem. For example, a consistently low effective rate indicates that invoices are often being written down. This could mean clients are not being quoted the correct amount, or that staff are being prevented from working efficiently and spending more time than expected.</p>
        <p><b>To generate a Billing report:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure you have the <i>WIP and Billing</i> permission.</p>
            </li>
