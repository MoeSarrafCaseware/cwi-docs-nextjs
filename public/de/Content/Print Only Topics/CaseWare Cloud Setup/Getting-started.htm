        <p>Before you can start working on any engagement, you need to set up the new Caseware Cloud portal for your firm. Caseware offers a comprehensive Getting Started guide (https://docs.caseware.com/2019/webapps/30/en/Explore/Getting-Started/Get-started-with-Caseware-Cloud.htm) that walks you through the common tasks for new Cloud firms. For the purpose of this training, there are three steps that you need to do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>set up workspaces in Caseware Cloud for each of your clients</li>
            <li>create accounts for your staff members</li>
            <li>create accounts for your clients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This training walks you through the process of completing the above steps. Once you complete them, you are ready to create an engagement. After we walk through these steps, we&apos;ll also go over how to manage firm settings.</p>
