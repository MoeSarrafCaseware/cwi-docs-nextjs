        <h1>Complete the engagement acceptance</h1>
        <p>You have completed all the steps for the initial setup of your Caseware ReviewComp engagement.</p>
        <p>You have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Created the engagement</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reviewed the engagement properties</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are ready to begin working in the engagement itself. The next step is to complete the pre-engagement acceptance procedures.</p>
        <h2>The Documents page</h2>
        <p>When you open your Caseware ReviewComp engagement, you are automatically brought to the <b>Documents</b> page. This page is the starting point for most of the work that you will perform in the engagement.</p>
        <p>Your engagement documents are grouped by their phase in the engagement workflow. There are three categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Planung</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Feldforschung</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Schlussfolgerung</b></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you first open your engagement, only the <b>Planning</b> phase will be visible.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Phase-progress-indicator.flsnp" /><p>As you complete procedures and sign off documents within your engagement, additional phases and documents will become available to you. Documents in each category are organized into subfolders for better accessibility and presentation.</p>
        <h2>Complete the Optimiser document</h2>
        <p>The contents of the <b>Documents</b> page depend on the type of engagement being performed. The following sections of this guide walk you through a <b>Compilation</b> engagement.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>Open the <b>0-10 Planning Optimiser</b> document. You will use this document to provide initial information about the client and the engagement type.</p>
        <p>The Planning Optimiser is a checklist document. Each checklist document contains a set of procedures that the engagement preparer can input answers for. Most of the engagement work in ReviewComp engagements is completed in checklists.</p>
        <p>As you complete procedures in this checklist, other documents will be added to your engagement. Select the <b>Documents</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/docs-pane-top.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) on the side panel.</p>
        <div class="nobreak">
            <p>Complete the procedures in the <b>Planning Optimiser</b> document as follows:</p>
            <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/RCT-training-planning-optimiser-1.jpg" alt="The Planning Optimiser." /></p>
            <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/RCT-training-planning-optimiser-2.jpg" alt="The Planning Optimiser." /></p>
        </div>
        <p>Once you have completed the procedures, you can sign off on the document to indicate that it is complete. At the top of the document, select the hollow circle icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-signoff-for-documents-2.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />), then select <b>Sign off</b> to sign-off the preparer&apos;s role.</p>
        <p>Under the Next step section, select <b>1.1 Engagement acceptance/continuance</b> to proceed to performing acceptance/continuance.</p>
        <h2>Perform acceptance/continuance</h2>
        <p>You must complete the <b>1.1 Engagement acceptance/continuance</b> as part of the engagement process.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>Complete and sign off the checklist as shown below.</p>
        <p>When you are done, under the Next step section select the <b>Client queries - Engagement letters, document and records</b>.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/RCT-Training-acceptance-1.jpg" alt="The Engagement acceptance/continuance." /></p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/RCT-Training-acceptance-2.jpg" alt="The Engagement acceptance/continuance." /></p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/RCT-Training-acceptance-3.jpg" alt="The Engagement acceptance/continuance." /></p>
        <h2>Review and complete the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>In the <b>Client queries - Engagement letters, documents and records</b> query, navigate to the <i>Engagement letter - Compilation 4200</i> question set and open the <i>1.10 Compilation engagement letter.pdf</i>. The <b>1.10 Compilation engagement letter</b> document opens, which is a draft version of your engagement letter that automatically generates based on your responses from previous procedures.</p>
        <p class="image"><img src="../../Resources/Images/RCT-Training-engagement-letter.jpg" alt="The Engagement letter." /></p>
        <p>Your letter includes guidance information, as seen above. Guidance is displayed by default, but is not included when you print the letter. You can switch off guidance from <b>More actions</b> (<b>...</b>).</p>
        <h2>Edit the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>The engagement letter draft uses blue drop-down menus to indicate areas where you have to enter information specific to your engagement. At the top of the letter, the number of placeholders indicates the remaining number of areas you need to complete. You can select the Placeholder text to go to the next unset area.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/RCT-Training-engagement-letter-placeholders.jpg" alt="The Engagement letter." /></p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>Complete the drop-downs in the engagement letter as required.</p>
        <p>When you click on drop-downs that require a contact&apos;s name, for example, <b>Person to whom the engagement letter is sent</b>, the option to <b>Search for contact</b> displays. Select the Search box and begin typing.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/search-for-contact.png" alt="Search for contact" /></p>
        <p>A list of matches displays. If the desired person is not in the list, you can select <b>Add New Contact</b> and enter the contact&apos;s information as desired.</p>
        <p>If an expected contact is not listed, edit their profile from the <b>Contacts</b> page in Cloud and ensure they have the <b>Contact - Entity Collaborator</b> role assigned.</p>
        <p>To edit the text of the letter, select the <b>Edit</b> icon(<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>Text areas will be displayed with gray backgrounds. You can select the text area to change the content. Once you have finished editing the area, select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-blue.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) again to save your changes.</p>
        <p>Review the letter and update any sections with placeholder text. These are shown in blue text, for example, <span style="color: #0000ff;">[name of organization]</span>.</p>
        <p>Once you have finished editing the document, you will be ready to configure the print settings.</p>
        <h2>Configure the print settings for the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>You have filled in all the placeholders in your letter with real content, entering dates and client names and adding in any mandated content for letters in your firm. Next, you should add a header to your letter that includes your firm name, and you should set the page size for your letter.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>Select <b>More actions (...) | Print Settings</b> to display the Print Settings dialog.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/RCT-Training-print-settings.jpg" alt="The Print Settings dialog." /></p>
        <p>Select the <b>Header</b> area to expand it and display the text editing menu. From the menu, select the <b>Insert Formula</b> icon (<i>fx</i>). The Data Link dialog displays. Select the <b>Firm Properties</b> tab, and then select the <b>Firm name</b> to add it to your header.</p>
        <p>You can set a specific page size by choosing it from the <b>Page Size</b> pull-down. Set the page size to <b>Letter</b>.</p>
        <p>You can also:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change the page orientation to <b>Landscape</b> (the default is portrait)</li>
            <li>Adjust the <b>Margins</b></li>
            <li>Include or exclude a document&apos;s table of contents from the page numbering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have changed your print settings, select <b>Save</b>.</p>
        <p>You can select the <b>Print</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-print-inline.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) at the top of the letter to see a sample of your engagement letter with the header included. Use this option to save a copy of the letter as a PDF.</p>
        <h4>Bulk Print Settings</h4>
        <p>You can also configure <b>Bulk Print Settings</b> in the <b>Documents</b> page to group two or more documents and print them as a single PDF. You can configure more than one document group and include the same document in multiple groups.</p>
        <p>Once you configure a bulk print group, it displays in the print options in the <b>Documents</b> page and in each document within that group. Note that with bulk prints configured, you still have the option to print a document individually.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/to-set-up-bulk-print.flsnp" /></body>
