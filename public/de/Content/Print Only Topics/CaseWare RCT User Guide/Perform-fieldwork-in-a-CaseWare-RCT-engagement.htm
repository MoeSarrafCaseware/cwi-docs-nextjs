        <h1>Perform fieldwork in a Caseware ReviewComp engagement</h1>
        <p>You need to present and substantiate your analysis of the trial balance and any other applicable data sources in the Fieldwork phase. The documents that you need to complete in this phase and the way you want to present the financial statements depend on the responses you provide in the <b>Fieldwork Optimiser</b>.</p>
        <p>This phase also consists of checklist documents (worksheets) that are designed to streamline specific areas of your engagement. For example, the <b>3-94 Worksheet - Sales tax</b> helps you determine if the engagement data contains sufficient information to assess the reasonableness of GST/HST amounts receivable or payable.</p>
        <p>Some of a Review engagement fieldwork tasks include:</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> Make sure all the documents in this phase are signed off by the designated preparer and reviewer.</p>

        <h2><a name="Complete"></a>Complete the Fieldwork Optimiser</h2>
        <p>To complete the engagement fieldwork tasks, you need to <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Planning/Complete-a-checklist.htm#Viewclientresponsesrelatedtochecklistprocedures">respond to the inquiries</a> in the Fieldwork Optimiser document. For example, specify the optional documents that you want to use or whether or not you want to use the tax payable method.</p>
        <p>Based on your responses, additional worksheets or letters may become available at the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
        <h2><a name="Perform"></a>Perform data analysis</h2>
        <p>Your next step after responding to the Fieldwork Optimiser inquires is to proceed to <b>3-01 Analytical overview</b> document to perform data analysis. This is where you look for trends, compare and calculate ratios, investigate discrepancies and confirm expectations.</p>
        <p>In the <b>3-01 Analytical overview</b> document:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You can hide or display specific charts by selecting the toggles (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-toggle-analysis.png" />) at the top of the page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can use the drop-downs at the top to switch the display between <b>Preliminary</b> balances and <b>Final</b> balances.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Each chart has a section where you can enter comments or notes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can hover the graphs to view a tooltip that shows the data a specific bar or line represents. Note that the corresponding data in the table is highlighted as well.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/analysis-data-tooltip.PNG" alt="3-01 Analytical overview" /></p>
        <p>If you hover the data labels in the table, a tooltip displays showing the definition of each label and the formula used to calculate it.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/analysis-def-formula-tooltip.PNG" alt="3-01 Analytical reivew: Data presentation in table" /></p>
        <p>In the overall bar chart, you can select a specific financial statement area to open the corresponding bar chart as an alternative to enabling it using the toggles at the top of the page. In the following figure, we selected <i>Total expense</i> to display a separate bar chart for it below.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/fs-area-chart.png" alt="3-01 Analytical review: Overall chart." /></p>
        <p>In a financial area bar chart, you can remove one or more data set from the chart and compare results. Select <b>Edit</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-chart.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />), then select <b>Delete</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-remove-dataset-from-chart.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 20px;height: 20px;" />) to remove one or more data set. You can revert to the original chart by selecting the <b>Edit</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-chart.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) then <b>Revert</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-revert.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 15px;height: 22px;" />).</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/edit-mode-in-chart.PNG" alt="Edit mode in charts." /></p>
        <p>Analysis sheets for the relevant financial areas in your engagement are also available for review.</p>
        <p>Based on your responses in the Fieldwork Optimiser, these analysis sheets can be found in the <b>Analysis</b> section in the <b>Documents</b> page or grouped by the corresponding financial area. For example, you can find the <b>3-03 Liabilities and Equity analysis</b> sheet in the <b>Analysis</b> section or in the <b>Liabilities and equity</b> section in the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
        <p>The default view in analysis sheets is to show data for accounts and groups. You can modify the setting to show groups only or accounts only.</p>

        <h2><a name="Review"></a>Review work programs</h2>
        <p>You need to <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Planning/Complete-a-checklist.htm">complete the work programs</a> you have designated as material when you <a href="Plan-your-CaseWare-RCT-engagement.htm#Define">scoped your engagement</a>. Each work program relates to a specific financial statement area and consist of five sections:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Part A - Obtain an understanding.</li>
            <li>Part B - Additional procedures.</li>
            <li>Part C - Completion and Reporting.</li>
            <li>Financial Reporting Framework (If you&apos;ve selected ASPE framework in the <a href="Plan-your-CaseWare-RCT-engagement.htm">Planning Optimiser</a>).</li>
            <li>Conclusion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> In the <b>FINANCIAL REPORTING FRAMEWORK</b> section, Caseware ReviewComp provides a list of possible significant accounting policies and note disclosures. You can select the relevant items you want to include in the financial statements.</p>
        <p>Each work program has an analysis tab that provides a visual representation of data for the financial statement area, as well the relevant ratios.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/3A-cash-and-cash-equiv-worksheet.PNG" alt="3-A Cash and cash equivalents worksheet" /></p>
        <h2><a name="Complete2"></a>Complete the applicable worksheets</h2>
        <p>CPA Canada has defined a number of optional worksheets in engagements. In the Fieldwork Optimiser, you can specify which worksheets you want to complete as part of the fieldwork tasks. At <b>Optional documents</b>, select <i>Yes</i> next to the worksheets you want to include.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/3-00-fieldwork-optimiser1.png" alt="The Optional documents section in the 3-00 Fieldwork Optimiser document." /></p>
        <p>Once you select <i>Yes</i> next to a worksheet, it becomes available in the <b>Documents</b> page. <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Planning/Complete-a-checklist.htm">Complete the available worksheets</a> and ensure that they&apos;re signed off by the designated preparer and reviewer.</p>
        <h2><a name="Evaluate"></a>Evaluate the obtained evidence</h2>
        <p>In this step, you evaluate the relevance and reliability of the information to be used as evidence. For example, identify whether the evidence obtained from one source is inconsistent with that obtained from another.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the obtained evidence in a Review engagement, complete the following worksheets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>4-10-1 Worksheet - Accumulation of identified misstatements - identification</b></li>
            <li><b>4-10-2 Worksheet - Accumulation of identified misstatements - procedures</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also document your notes on significant matters by completing the <b>4-20 Notes on significant decisions</b> worksheet. For example, list the identified significant matters or document any changes or additions to procedures to resolve the matter and the conclusions reached.</p>
