        <h1>Perform the engagement acceptance or continuance procedures</h1>
        <p>Most of the engagement work in Caseware ReviewComp is completed via checklists. To perform acceptance or continuance procedures, <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Planning/Complete-a-checklist.htm#Viewclientresponsesrelatedtochecklistprocedures">complete</a> the <b>Planning Optimiser</b> checklist.</p>
        <p>The <b>Planning Optimiser</b> consists of a set of questions designed to determine the scope and nature of your engagement. It also includes an <b>Instructions</b> tab that describes the purpose and scope of the document as it relates to regulatory standards.</p>
        <p>As you provide responses, further documents are added to the engagement. Once you respond to the last question, the <b>Next step</b> section displays with a link to the document that you&apos;ll need to complete next.</p>
        <p>For example, if you&apos;ve specified that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The engagement type is a <i>Review</i>,</li>
            <li>This is not their first year of operations and</li>
            <li>You did perform their engagement last year,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>then the following documents are available in the <b>Documents</b> page for client acceptance/continuance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>1-20 Existing engagement - Continuance</b>, a checklist confirming your firm&apos;s readiness and suitability to perform the engagement work.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>1-50 Review engagement letter</b>, a letter to be completed and given to your client to sign.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>1-55 Client queries - Engagement letter</b>, where your client will upload their signed copy of the engagement letter.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bitte beachten Sie:<ul><li><p>If you&apos;re working on a compilation engagement and want to implement the 4200 Compilation standards, make sure you respond <i>Yes</i> to the question <i>Would you like to include the new 4200 CSRS standards?</i> To learn more, see <a href="Implement-the-4200-Compilation-standards.htm">Implement the 4200 Compilation standards.</a></p></li><li><p>The <i>Select if any of the following mapping groups apply to your engagement</i> question prompts you to select the applicable mapping groups for your engagement. For example, if you select <i>Farming</i>, then only account groupings relevant to farming will be available in the engagement, while other groupings will be hidden. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Accounts-and-Analysis/Assign-accounts-to-groups-in-the-Data-page.htm">Assign accounts to groups in the Data page.</a></p></li></ul><p>You can view a list of the current documents in the engagement by selecting the folder icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/docs-pane-top.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />). A panel opens on the right side showing the available documents grouped by phase. You can also select a document to open it. Once you open a document, you can pin it for quick access using the pin icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-pin-14x18.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />).</p><p>To sign off on the Planning Optimiser as either a <b>Preparer</b> or <b>Reviewer</b>, select <b>Sign Off</b> at the top-right corner of the document.</p><p>To learn more about checklist documents, see <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Modify-or-add-a-checklist.htm">Modify or add a checklist.</a></p></p>
        <h2>Notify the document&apos;s reviewer</h2>
        <p>To notify the staff member acting as the reviewer that the engagement acceptance document is ready for review, create an issue and assign it to them.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To add an issue:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>With the document open, select the <b>Issue</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-issues-global-inline.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter a message for the staff member.</p>
            </li>
            <p class="tip"><b>Tipp:</b> You can also tag a member by entering (<b>@</b>) followed by the member name. If they have access to the document, their name appears in the <b>Quick List</b> dialog.</p>
            <li>
                <p>Select their name to tag them in the issue&apos;s description.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose the issue type and select <b>Create Issue.</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The issue displays in the document. It also displays in the Issues page or on the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the reviewer signs off on a document, the green check mark displays next to the document (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-se-reviewed-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) on the <b>Documents</b> page. The progress indicator for the Planning phase is also updated.</p>
        <h2>Review and edit the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>The draft version of your engagement letter is automatically generated based on your responses in the Planning Optimiser, as well as your firm&apos;s Cloud profile.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> You must accept the <b>Partner/practitioner assessment</b> section in either the <b>1-20 Existing engagement - Continuance</b> or the <b>1-10 New engagement - Acceptance</b> checklist or both (if both are available in the engagement) to view the <b>Next step</b> section, which provides a direct link to the draft engagement letter.</p>
        <p>Notes and guidance information are available in the letter at the section marked with a lightbulb icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-lightbulb-guidance.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />). This section is visible by default but it&apos;s excluded when you print the letter. You can hide this section by selecting <b>More Actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) | <b>Guidance</b> | <b>Off</b> or <b>More Actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) | <b>Guidance</b> | <b>Collapsed</b>.</p>
        <p>To edit the letter content, select <b>Edit</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-inline.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />). See <a href="Edit-the-CaseWare-RCT-engagement-letter.htm">Edit the engagement letter</a> for more details.</p>
        <p>Once you&apos;re satisfied with the contents of the engagement letter, select <b>Sign Off</b> to perform the appropriate sign off. Once the content is reviewed, you can send a copy to your client.</p>
        <h2>Send the engagement letter to clients for review and signature</h2>
        <p>To obtain the client signature, you can send your draft directly to clients using query documents in Caseware ReviewComp. Query documents are intended for client collaboration, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Requesting information from clients (send inquires).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Requesting documents (ask the client to upload one or more files).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sending deliverables to the client to sign and return.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Simple Electronic Signature is available in select queries. Clients can electronically accept the engagement letter and other documents. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/File-Preparation/Staff-Contact-collaboration-(Queries).htm#SES">Simple Electronic Signature response type in queries.</a></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once client contacts sign in to Cloud, they can directly respond to queries.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To send the engagement letter to your clients:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the <b>1-55 Client queries - Engagement letter</b> document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the top-right corner of the document, select <b>SEND</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <p>The Open Query dialog opens.</p>
            <li>
                <p>Select a <b>Query Due Date</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Specify the contacts assigned to the engagement (or simply assign it to all contacts associated with the entity)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter an appropriate email message.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche <b>OK</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <p>Contacts receive an email with your message and a link to the engagement, where they can download a PDF version of the letter, sign and upload the signed copy.</p>
        </ol>
