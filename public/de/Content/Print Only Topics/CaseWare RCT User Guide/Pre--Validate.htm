        <h1>Pre-Validate</h1>
        <p>Pre-Validation is a CRA-integrated service that is available in the <b>EFILE</b> page. It identifies inconsistencies between the tax preparer&apos;s records and the CRA&apos;s records early on in the engagement to help reduce the number of submitted returns that contain errors</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To pre-validate:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Go to the <b>EFILE</b> page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter your CRA credentials.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <b>Pre-Validate</b> button.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Yes</b> in the confirmation dialog.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can select the <b>Pre-Validate Worksheet</b> link to navigate to the Pre-Validate Workchart, where you can view the data that will be sent to the CRA for before you continue with pre-validation.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/link-to-prevalidate-worksheet.PNG" alt="Confirmation dialog for pre-validation." /></p>
        <p>If the pre-validation is successful, a message displays the success.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/successfule-prevalidation.PNG" alt="Successful pre-validation." /></p>
        <p>If the pre-validation fails, an error message displays.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/prevalidation-error.PNG" alt="Error message for a failed pre-validation attempt." /></p>
        <p>Select <b>Close</b> to close the error message and go to the <b>Diagnostics</b> page, where you can view a summary of the errors that caused the prevalidation failure and navigate to the location of the error to correct it. To learn more, see <a href="Correct-errors-in-tax-returns.htm">Correct errors in your return</a>.</p>
        <p>Note that the <b>Last transmission results</b> section in the <b>Pre-Validate Workchart</b> displays a record of pre-validation attempts. In case of a failed attempt, you can select the description in the <b>Errors</b> column to go to the page where the error is located and correct it.</p>
        <p>Once you&apos;ve corrected all errors, you select the <b>Pre-Validate</b> button in the workchart to re-attempt the pre-validation.</p>

Note that the description in the Errors column links you to the page where the error is located. The Pre-Validate button is available so you can re-attempt the prevalidation." /></p>
