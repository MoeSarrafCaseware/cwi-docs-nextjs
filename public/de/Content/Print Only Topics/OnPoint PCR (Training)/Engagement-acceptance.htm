        <h1>Engagement acceptance</h1>
        <p>You have completed all the steps for the initial setup of your OnPoint PCR engagement. You have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>created the engagement file</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>reviewed the engagement properties</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now you are ready to begin working in the engagement file itself. The next step is to complete the pre-engagement acceptance procedures.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>The Documents page</h2>
        <p>When you open your OnPoint PCR engagement, you are automatically brought to the <b>Documents</b> page. This page is the starting point for almost all of the work that you will do on the engagement.</p>
        <p>Your engagement documents are grouped by their place in the engagement workflow. There are four large categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Engagement Acceptance and Planning</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Feldforschung</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Financial Statements and Wrap-up</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Permanent File</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: Some of these categories appear as you progress through your engagement.</p>
        <p>Three of the sections have a progress indicator that measures how close that part of the engagement is to being completed. The progress indicator displays a percentage that indicates how many of the documents in the section have been signed off on by a reviewer.</p>
        <p>In the <b>Permanent File</b> section, you can add supporting documents for the engagement. These documents will be carried forward when you create the next period&apos;s engagement for this client.</p>
        <p>When you start a new engagement, there are only a few documents visible on the page. As you complete procedures and sign off documents, other documents you will subsequently need are added to the documents page.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Complete the Engagement Acceptance and Continuance document</h2>
        <p>Open the <b>1-110 Engagement Acceptance and Continuance</b> document. In this document, you will provide initial information about the client and the engagement type.</p>
        <p>The <b>Engagement Acceptance and Continuance</b> document is a checklist. Each checklist document contains a set of questions that the engagement preparer can answer. Most of the engagement work in OnPoint PCR engagements is completed in checklists. As you complete questions in the <b>Engagement Acceptance and Continuance</b> document, other documents will be added to your engagement file.</p>
        <p>Complete the questions in the <b>Engagement Acceptance and Continuance</b> document. As you answer the questions, more will appear in the document.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Complete the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>The first two checklist documents that you have completed outline the basic engagement information. The draft version of your engagement letter has automatically been generated based on your responses in those checklists.</p>
        <p>At the top of the letter, you will see a guidance section. This contains information about the contents of the letter below, and includes instructions for finalizing the draft. Guidance is displayed by default, but it is not included when you print the letter. You can hide the guidance section by selecting <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) <b>|Guidance Off</b>.</p>
        <p>The engagement letter draft uses red text to indicate an area where you have to enter information specific to your engagement. Review the letter and update any sections with placeholder text.</p>
        <p>For example, the first text area contains firm information. The firm name and address are populated automatically based on values from your firm profile on Cloud, but there is red text here indicating that you should insert firm letterhead.</p>
        <p>To edit a text area in the letter, select the <b>Edit </b>icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) at the top-right of the document.</p>
        <p class="image"><img src="../../Resources/Images/engagement-letter-select-edit.png" alt="Edit Enagement letter draft - select edit icon" /></p>
        <p>The text area will be displayed with a gray background, and you can select the text area to change the content. Select <b>[Insert Firm Letterhead]</b> and then from the text editing menu, select the <b>Insert Image icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-insert-image-14x12.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
        <p class="image"><img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-engagement-letter-insert-image.png" /></p>
        <p>In the Image dialog, select <b>Choose File</b>. Find the image file for your firm letterhead, and then select <b>OK</b>.</p>
        <p class="image"><img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-engagement-letter-image-dialog-660x324.png" alt="Edit engagment letter - add letter head image" /></p>
        <p>The image is added to your text area. Once you have finished editing the area, select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) again to save your changes.</p>
        <p>You will also find pull-down menus embedded in parts of the letter. Like the red text, these menus are placeholders for information that you need to add to the letter.</p>
        <p>For example, in the second text area, you will see a pull-down menu that says <b>Today&apos;s Date</b>.</p>
        <p>When you select this menu, a calendar is displayed. Select a date from the calendar menu, and the date area in the letter displays the chosen date. Note that although the pull-down menu&apos;s background is no longer visible, you can still select the date to display the calendar menu and change your date.</p>
        <p>Review the rest of the letter draft, select values for each of the pull-down menus, and replace the red placeholder text with content specific for your engagement. Once you have finished editing the document and have inserted another image with your firm&apos;s signature, you will be ready to configure the print settings.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Configure the print settings for the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>You have filled in all the placeholders in your letter with real content, entering dates and client names and adding in any mandated content for letters in your firm. Next, add a header to your letter that includes your firm name, and set the page size for your letter.</p>
        <p>Select <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) <b>|</b> <b>Print Settings</b> to display the Print Settings dialog.</p>
        <p>Select the <b>Header</b> text area to expand it and display the text editing menu. From the menu, select the <b>Insert Formula</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-text-field-edit-insert-formula.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />). The Data Link dialog is displayed. Select the <b>Firm Properties</b> tab, and then select the <b>Firm name</b> to add it to your header.</p>
        <p>You can set a specific page size by choosing it from the <b>Page Size</b> pull-down menu. Set the page size to <b>Letter</b>.</p>
        <p>You can also:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>change the page orientation to landscape (the default is <b>Portrait</b>)</li>
            <li>adjust the margin width</li>
            <li>have a document&apos;s table of contents count in the page numbering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have changed your print settings, select <b>Save</b>. You can select the <b>Print</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-print-icon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) at the top of the letter to see a sample of your engagement letter with the header included.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Send the engagement letter to the client</h2>
        <p>Now that the draft of your engagement letter is ready, you need the client&apos;s signature in order to proceed with the engagement. You can send your draft directly to your client in OnPoint PCR by using a procedure.</p>
        <p>A <b>procedure</b> is a document that you can use to communicate directly with the client. You can use procedures for a number of things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><i>Request for information</i> - send questions to the client.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><i>Document request</i> - ask the client to upload one or more files.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><i>Send deliverables</i> - send documents to the client to sign and return.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your client has a contact account in Cloud, they can sign in and respond directly on procedures.</p>
        <p>Open the <b>Documents</b> page. Notice that there are more documents displayed here based on the questions that we responded to in the acceptance documents. In the <b>Engagement Acceptance and Planning</b> section, you will see a query document named <b>1-200 Engagement Letter (procedure to Client)</b>.</p>
        <p>Open this document. It asks the client to review and sign the attached draft of the engagement letter.</p>
        <p>Select <b>Send</b> to submit the query to the client. The Open Query dialog is displayed.</p>
        <p>Select a due date from the calendar menu. Next, assign the query to one of your client contacts. Select the contact search field that is displayed below it and then choose one of the contacts from the quick list. Finally, enter the following custom email message:`</p>
        <p><i>Please review the attached engagement letter, sign it, and return it to us. If you notice any problems in the letter, please inform us at once.</i></p>
        <p>Select <b>OK</b> to open the procedure. This also automatically updates the status of the engagement file to <b>Awaiting response</b>.</p>
        <p>The client will receive an email notifying them that there is an item in Cloud that requires their attention. When they log in, they will see your query under <b>My Work</b>.</p>
        <p>The client can download a copy of the PDF letter, review it, add their signature, and upload the signed document back to the same procedure. They can also add comments to the procedure, and these comments will be visible to your firm members in the engagement file.</p>
        <p>Once they have responded to all of the tasks on the procedure, they can mark the procedure as <b>Responded</b>. This updates the document status in the engagement file, and it also automatically updates the status of the engagement file to <b>procedures Ready</b>. Your client contacts can no longer see a procedure that has been marked as <b>Responded</b> on their Overview page, but they can still see the procedure on the <b>Activities</b> page.</p>

        <h2>Accept the signed engagement letter</h2>
        <p>When you review the procedure, you can see that the client has responded to the procedure, and you can either accept or decline the response. To accept the procedure, change the procedure status at the top of the document to <b>Complete</b>.</p>
        <p>When you accept the procedure, the signed letter is attached to the file, replacing the placeholder that was on the Documents page. The procedure will be locked to prevent any further editing.</p>
