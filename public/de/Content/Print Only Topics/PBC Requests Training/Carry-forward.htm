        <p>Now that we&apos;ve created the new engagement file, let&apos;s look at our carry forward options.</p>
        <p>When you open the new engagement and select the <b>Carry Forward</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-bulk-carry-forward.PNG" />) icon, you are presented with the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Carry forward all documents and files from the original engagement at once (bulk carry forward).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Dismiss the bulk carry forward and individually select which documents and files to move from the original engagement to the new one.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/pbc-carry-forward-documents.png" /></p>
        <p>If you open the Optimiser document, the carry forward options are also available so you can select which responses to move over to the new engagement.</p>

        <p>You can also review and choose which edits in documents to maintain or discard.</p>
