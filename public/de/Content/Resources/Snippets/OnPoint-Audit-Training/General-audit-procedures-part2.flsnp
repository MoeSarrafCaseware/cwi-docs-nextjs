        <p>If you have imported transactional data in your engagement and enabled AnalyticsAI (done during <b>1-200 Engagement set up</b>), you can perform journal entry testing to scan transaction sets and find exceptions that might warrant further investigation. This will reduce the time spent in transaction analysis by automatically performing multiple tests on the entire transaction set.</p>
