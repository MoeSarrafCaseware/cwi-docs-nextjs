        <p><b>C105Q Request for records and documents</b> consists of multiple sections to request records and documents that you might need in your audit engagement, such as <b>Property, plant and equipment</b>.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> The queries included in the <b>Documents</b> page in your engagement file depend on your response to the level of online collaboration question in <b>A100 Optimiser checklist - Initial Engagement Decisions.</b> If you have responded <i>High</i>, then document <b>C105Q</b> is not included — instead, an individual query for each financial statement area is included. For example, for <i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Property, Plant and Equipment</i>, the <i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">1.101Q</i> is included.</p>
