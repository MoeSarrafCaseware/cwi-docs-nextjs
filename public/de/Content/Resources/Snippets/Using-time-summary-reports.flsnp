        <p>You can generate summary reports in the Analysis app to give you high-level information about your costs and the time spent by your staff on engagement work.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose that you wanted to generate a summary of all the time spent on each of your engagements during the last quarter, and the costs for that work.</p>
        <p>To do this, create a summary report. On the Analysis app, you should set your <b>Format</b> to Summary, your <b>Group by</b> to Entity, and set the date range using the first and last days of your previous quarter.</p>
