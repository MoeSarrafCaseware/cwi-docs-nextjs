        <p>Influencers are accounts that you want to emphasize as part of your risk analysis. They capture macroeconomic and organizational risk and highlight transactions that may be of interest in light of those risks.</p>
        <p>For example, if you suspect that there are control weaknesses over cash accounts, you might set the influencer for any cash accounts to raise the score by a specific percentage. You could set the influencer for cash accounts to, say 50%, and the risk scores of any transactions which contain cash accounts will be automatically increased by 50%. Transactions with zero risk will not be adjusted, and therefore will remain at zero risk.</p>
        <p>In a less trivial example, suppose an auditor was auditing a mature organization, whose motivation was to reduce paid tax. The auditor could set an influencer for any discretionary revenue accrual accounts so that any risk scores on transactions containing those accounts are automatically increased.</p>
