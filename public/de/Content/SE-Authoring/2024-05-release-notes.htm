        <h2>Bulk actions for documents</h2>
        <p><a href="End-user.htm">#enduser</a> <a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a> <a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a></p>
        <p>The <b>Documents</b> page now features the option to make changes to multiple documents at once.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/documents-page-bulk-actions-setting.png" alt="The Bulk actions setting in the More actions menu for the Documents page." /></p>
        <p>When you turn on the <b>Bulk actions</b> option from the <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions-inline.png" alt=" " style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) menu on the <b>Documents</b> page, you can select multiple documents and then move, delete or sign off on all of those documents at once.</p>
        <p>Bitte beachten Sie:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Firm authors cannot delete documents created by primary authors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>End users cannot delete documents created by primary authors or firm authors</p>
            </li>

        <p>When users bulk sign off on documents, they can review the documents before they complete sign off. The <b>Status</b> column in the Review dialog informs users of additional information they may want to be aware of before they sign off on the documents. For example, if they are signing off on a checklist but not all the procedures have been signed off on, the <b>Status</b> column displays this information. They will also be informed if they have selected any documents that cannot be signed off on.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>VIEW BY</b> filter is now set to <b>Indicators</b> by default. The <b>Categories</b> option for the filter has been renamed to <b>Cycles</b> or <b>Areas</b> depending on whether cycles or areas are used in the risk library. If indicators are not used in the risk library, the risks are displayed by cycles or areas instead.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Collapsed risk cards now display any assertions applied to the risk as well as the cycle or area associated with the risk, if applicable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The number indicator for risk groups is now larger and displays next to the group name instead of on the far right side of the screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>Category</b> dropdown is now the <b>Cycles</b> or <b>Areas</b> dropdown depending on whether cycles or areas are used in the risk library. Risk groups display as subcategories of the cycles or areas they’re associated with in the dropdown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>Cycles</b> filter is now available so you can filter risks by cycle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can now collapse and expand all cycles or all risk groups.</p>

        <p>Dynamic table columns are now set to hide automatically if the column contains only zero balances from the table settings.</p>
        <p>When you create a new dynamic table in a template or engagement, the <b>Hide zero balance columns</b> setting is turned on by default. For any existing dynamic tables created prior to this release, the setting is turned off.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All five heading levels for areas and notes can now be displayed in the table of contents.</p>

        <p>The following updates have been made to the Materiality form.</p>
        <h3>Guidance information sections</h3>

        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/materiality-document-overall-materiality.png" alt="The Overall Materiality section of the materiality document with both primary author and firm author guidance sections." /></p>
        <h3>Qualitative disclosures section</h3>

        <h3>Performance materiality based on preset percentages</h3>
        <p>You can now choose to define preset percentages to calculate the Performance Materiality levels. Firm authors can customize the percentage values. Any updates made to the product template in the future will not override the customizations made by the firm author.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/materiality-document-performance-materiality.png" alt="The Performance Materiality section of the materiality document." /></p>

        <p>Firm authors can customize the percentage values. Any updates made to the product template in the future will not override the customizations made by the firm author.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/materiality-document-trivial-misstatements.png" alt="The Trivial misstatement section of the materiality document." /></p>
        <h2>New for authors</h2>
        <p>Here is what&apos;s new for authors in SE 2024-05.</p>
        <h3>Dynamic account reassignment for secondary grouping structures</h3>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online">#primaryauthor</a></p>
        <p>The <b>Reassign target for contrary accounts</b> property is now available for financial groups in secondary grouping structures. This allows you to set up dynamic account reassignment for groups in these structures.</p>
        <h3>Components for Risk Library content</h3>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online">#primaryauthor</a></p>
        <p>You can now assign components to the following content in your Risk Library:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Risiken</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Risk groups</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Procedures</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Kontrollen</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Control objectives</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Risk Library template file has been updated to include a sheet to define components. Columns have also been added to existing sheets so components can be assigned to content. Note that any components included in the risk library must already exist within your product template.</p>
        <h3>Components for firm authors</h3>
        <p><a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a></p>
        <p>Firm authors can now create their own components and component categories in the firm template. Once they’ve created their components, they can assign components to content in the firm template, including content created by the primary author. Note that firm authors do not have access to customize the Risk Library and cannot assign components to this content.</p>
        <p>As part of this feature, firm authors can also view the components and component categories created by the primary author, any visibility logic associated with these components, and which components are assigned to content in the template.</p>
        <p>Firm authors cannot modify or delete components, component categories or component assignments to content created by the primary author, but they can add their own components to categories created by the primary author.</p>
        <p>Note that while firm authors can assign components to financial groups they create, they cannot assign any components to primary author created groups.</p>

        <h3>Cut and paste dynamic tables</h3>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a></p>
        <p>You can now cut and paste dynamic tables. This feature allows you to easily move dynamic tables from one part of the financial statements to another.</p>
        <p>To cut a dynamic table, select <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions-inline.png" alt=" " style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) | <b>Cut section</b>.</p>

        <h2>New for end users</h2>
        <p>Here is what&apos;s new for end users in SE 2024-05.</p>
        <h3>Sync trial balance across engagements</h3>
        <p>When users import data into their engagement from another engagement, they can now select the <b>Sync Trial Balance</b> option to automatically sync data from the source engagement. This allows them to make changes to the data in the source engagement and automatically share those changes with synced engagements.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/engagement-search-dialog-sync-trial-balance.png" style="width: 522px;height: 435px;" alt="The Sync Trial Balance option in the Engagement Search dialog."></img></p>
        <p>When engagement data is synced from another engagement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A link to the source engagement displays on the <b>Data</b> page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Users cannot edit accounts, groups or adjustments synced from the source engagement.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Users can create issues and annotations for synced accounts and groups but cannot create annotations for synced adjustments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When changes are made to the source engagement, users in the destination engagement receive a notification to inform them that those changes have been applied to their file. Engagements are resynced every five minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If users lock down an engagement that contains data synced from a source engagement, changes made in the source engagement are no longer synced.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If both the source and destination engagement are carried forward, the carried forward files are automatically linked so users can continue to sync data from the current year source engagement.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
