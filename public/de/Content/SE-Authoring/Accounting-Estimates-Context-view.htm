        <h1>Accounting Estimates - Context view</h1>
        <p>The <b>Accounting Estimates - Context view</b> is a new approach to documenting the audit work required for accounting estimates. By combining several documents, it enables you to view all content “in context”. The revised workflow of this “in context” approach makes it easier for auditors to see the relevant information for each significant accounting estimate.</p>
        <p>The following information outlines the key improvements included in the <b>Accounting Estimates - Context view</b>, compared to the historical approach (documenting work in various checklists):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The retrospective review of all significant accounting estimates is automatically populated from each of the detailed accounting estimate documents, ensuring consistency in the engagement file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The overview of each estimate includes a summary of key information and audit work completed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The primary work for a significant accounting estimate is completed in one document, from understanding the accounting estimate and related risks to responding to those identified risks, making it easier to understand the issues related to each accounting estimate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Each significant accounting estimate has its own document and additional documents can be added as required for the engagement within each financial statement area.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <b>Accounting Estimates - Context</b> view includes two SE Builder forms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Accounting Estimates</b> - A repeater type document that can be duplicated as many times as required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Overview of the prior period accounting estimates</b> - A summary of the information for all accounting estimate forms.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
