        <h1>Cash flow import / copy-paste tool</h1>
        <p><b>Cash flow import / copy-paste tool</b> has been developed to assist our users to efficiently transfer the cash flow statement balances from external sources (Excel or CSV worksheets) into dynamic tables within the financial statements.</p>
        <p>Once the <b>Cash flow import / copy-paste tool</b> has been integrated with your solution, select <strong>Add</strong> (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-add-15x15.png" alt=" " style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) on your <b>Documents</b> page and add the following documents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Cash flow import</b> - The main form which includes all the functionality, for both the Indirect and the Direct Cash flow methods.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>PA - Cash flow statement structures table</b> - An SE Builder form that is required to support the functionality of the main form. You must add this worksheet to your Documents page but you can always hide it by using the visibility settings.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>GC - Author mode visibility form</b> - An SE Builder form that drives the visibility settings on the content of the form based on the type of author that is accessing it. You must add this worksheet to your <b>Documents</b> page but you can always hide it by using the visibility settings.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> <b>GC - Author mode visibility form</b> is a form that is used by other Global Components forms. If it was previously added to your solution, there are no other changes you have to perform.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
