        <p>If you want group numbers to appear with the group description in the trial balance, select the <b>Show group numbers for financials</b> check box. This is useful for markets that don&apos;t have a standard chart of accounts and want to simplify the trial balance by not displaying group numbers. This setting also shows group numbers in the Caseware Cloud Connector Add-in (see image below). To learn more, see <a href="How-to-get-started-with-Cloud-Connector.htm">How to get started with Cloud Connector</a>.</p>
