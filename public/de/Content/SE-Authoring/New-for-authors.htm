        <h1>New for authors</h1>
        <p>Here is what&apos;s new for authors in SE 2024-09.</p>
        <h2>Set the ability to add groups from the product settings</h2>
        <p><a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a> <a href="Network-author.htm">#networkauthor</a></p>
        <p>Network authors and firm authors can now determine if end users can add financial groups in engagements. While primary authors still retain the ability to define if this feature is available to end users in the product.json file, network authors and firm authors can now override the primary author’s settings to customize their template.</p>
        <p>To determine whether end users can add financial groups, authors can modify the <b>Enable user-defined financial groups</b> checkbox on the <b>Data</b> tab of the product settings.</p>
        <p>Note that the <b>Enable user-defined financial groups</b> checkbox is also available to primary authors, so you can control whether end users can add financial groups without having to edit the product.json file.</p>

        <h2>Improvement to risk scales</h2>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a> <a href="Network-author.htm">#networkauthor</a></p>
        <p>You can now set seven levels for risk scales instead of the five that were previously available.</p>
