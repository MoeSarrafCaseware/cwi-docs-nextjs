        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">Recommendations for multi-language implementation</h1>
        <p>Here are the implementation recommendations for multi-language support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>To set up translated versions for note disclosures: Create multiple versions of the notes in different languages with visibility settings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To set up translated versions for letters: Create multiple versions of the letter sections in different languages with visibility settings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To set up translated query questions and checklist procedures: Create multiple versions of the procedures and query questions in different languages using dynamic text.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For detailed instructions, see <a href="Use--case---A-product-with-French-and-English-language-support.htm">Use- case: A template with French and English language support</a>.</p>
        <p>Bitte beachten Sie:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Multi-language support feature does not automatically translate content. You must provide the translations for the languages that you want your SE product to support.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you delete a language, the translated text that you have added in the template is not deleted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On carry forward, the selected content language is carried over to the next period&apos;s file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Firm authors cannot add or delete languages but they can make all other changes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Firm author changes for content language are not overridden when they update the firm template with the latest change from the product template.</p>
            </li>
            <p>However, there is one exception:</p>
            <p>If firm authors make a language active in the firm template, then you change it to inactive in the product template. In this case, your settings override what&apos;s in the firm template once firm authors <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Manage-the-firm-template.htm#Updatethefirmtemplate">update</a> it - and the language becomes inactive.</p>
        </ul>
