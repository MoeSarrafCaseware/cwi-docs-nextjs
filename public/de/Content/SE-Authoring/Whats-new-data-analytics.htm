        <h2>AnalyticsAI</h2>
        <h3>Notebooks updates</h3>
        <p>Distributors can now deploy and enable custom Notebooks in their AnalyticsAI product. Additionally, distributors and primary authors can define default parameters and autorun capability for a Notebook. The configuration options must be defined in the relevant product.json file.</p>
        <p>See <a href="https://developers.caseware.com/developers_content/v1/Get-started-with-Analytics-AI-Notebooks-SDK/Overview-NotebooksSDK.htm">Get started with AnalyticsAI Notebooks SDK</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2>Data import</h2>
        <h3>Imports improvements</h3>
        <p>This release includes a minor update to the new desktop file import capabilities that were made available in the DA-11 release. With this update, users that navigate back to the file upload configuration form either during an initial import, or on re-import will be able to view and edit the files that have been uploaded.</p>
        <h3>Other improvements</h3>
        <p>Improved integration with New Relic APM (app performance monitoring) to support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased transparency on import from start to finish</li>
            <li>Improved metrics on app performance and load times</li>
        </ul>
