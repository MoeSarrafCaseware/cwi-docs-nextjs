                <li>Instead of an Order Form with Caseware, Customer's order details (e.g., product type, quantity, term, etc.) will be set out in the order placed with Caseware by the Partner on Customer's behalf, and the Partner is responsible for the accuracy of any such order as communicated to Caseware.</li>
                <li>If Customer is entitled to a refund under this Agreement, then unless otherwise specified by Caseware, Caseware will refund any applicable Fees to the Partner and the Partner will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to Customer.</li>
                <li>Partners are not authorized to modify this Agreement or make any promises or commitments on Caseware's behalf without Caseware's explicit written approval, absent which, Caseware will not bound by any obligations to Customer other than as set forth in this Agreement.</li>

            <p>12,7 <u>Waiver</u>. The waiver by either Party of a breach or default of any provision of this Agreement by the other Party shall not be effective unless in writing and shall not be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or of any other provision.

            <p>12,8 <u>Assignment</u>. Neither Party may assign the Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise without the other Party's prior written consent, and any such purported assignment shall be void, provided that either Party's rights and obligations may be assigned to an Affiliate or another entity in connection with a reorganization, merger, sale, consolidation, acquisition or other restructuring involving all or substantially all of the voting securities and/or assets of that Party.</p>

Any Party claiming a Force Majeure Event shall use reasonable diligence to remove the condition that prevents performance and shall not be entitled to suspend the performance of its obligations in any greater scope or for any longer duration than is required by the Force Majeure Event. Each Party shall use its best efforts to mitigate the effects of such Force Majeure Event, remedy its inability to perform, and resume full performance of its obligations hereunder, provided, however, that in the event the Force Majeure Event continues for one-hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of the occurrence, and such failure to perform would constitute a material breach of this Agreement in the absence of such force majeure, the non-performing Party may terminate this Agreement pursuant by written notice to the other Party and in accordance with Section 11 of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>12.12 <u>Severability</u>. Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement may be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited or invalid under Applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent to such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.</p>
