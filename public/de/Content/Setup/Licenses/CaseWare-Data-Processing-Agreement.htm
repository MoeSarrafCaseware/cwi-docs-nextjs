            <p><b>5 Data Subjects</b>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Customer's clients/service recipients;</p>

            <p><b>6 Place of Data Processing</b>
            </p>
            <p>Caseware uses third party data hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host the Services and to act as Sub-Processors on servers located throughout the world. At present, Caseware uses servers in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the United States.</p>
            <p>At the time of subscribing to Caseware Services, Customer will be advised as to the geographic server that will host Personal Data and will be given an opportunity to consent thereto prior to Personal Data of Customer being stored with any such data hosting provider.</p>
            <p>Caseware will reasonably attempt to allocate a server in a geographically proximate location to the Customer so as to avoid cross-border transfer of the Personal Data. Where that is not possible, legally required authorisation mechanisms will be applied with the consent of the Customer, including for the provision of technical support and maintenance services requested by the Customer.</p>
            <p><b>7 Instructions</b>
            </p>
            <p>Caseware shall process Personal Data for the purposes of: (i) processing as required by Customers in their use of the Services; (ii) processing in accordance with the MPSA, this DPA and any other agreements between the Parties, (iii) processing to comply with other reasonable instructions provided by Customer where such instructions are consistent with the terms of the MPSA, applicable laws and DPA. Caseware will inform Customer if, in Caseware's opinion, the Customer's instructions or requests are contrary to Data Protection Laws, with reasons therefore by email.</p>
            <p><b>8 Confidentiality Commitment by Caseware</b>
            </p>
            <p>Caseware will ensure (a) the reliability of all individuals who could potentially access the Personal Data through background checks; (b) that all such individuals are subject to confidentiality undertakings at least as restrictive as those set forth in the MPSA and will treat the Personal Data as Confidential Information; and (c) that all such individuals have undergone training in the care, protection, and handling of Personal Data.</p>
            <p><b>9 Technical &amp; Organizational Measures</b>
            </p>
            <p>Caseware shall implement the necessary technical and organizational measures ("<b>TOMs</b>") to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. These may include, as appropriate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>the pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Data;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>availability and resilience of processing systems and services;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing and maintaining these measures for the duration of the contract.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Caseware will implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect Customer's Personal Data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, alteration or disclosure. When implementing and updating such technical and organisational measures ensuring a level of security appropriate to the risk, Caseware will have regard to the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Caseware has carried out the technical and organizational measures ("<b>TOMs</b>") specified in <b>Attachment 1</b> to this DPA.</p>
            <p>Caseware engages approved Sub-Processors to provide parts of the Services. The TOMs therefore depend partially on these Sub-Processors, as also described in <b>Attachment 1</b>, provided that Caseware remains responsible for its compliance with the TOMS regardless of its reliance on Sub-Processors. Caseware may decide on commercially reasonable improvements of the TOMs and provide the Customer on request with an updated <b>Attachment 1</b>.</p>
            <p><b>10 Global Privacy Officer</b>
            </p>
            <p>Caseware has appointed its Sr. Director of Legal as Caseware's Global Chief Privacy Officer.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Customer acknowledges and agrees that Caseware may engage Sub-Processors in the provision of Services, subject to the terms and conditions of this DPA, and that (i) a Caseware Affiliate may be retained as a Sub-Processor; and (ii) Caseware or a Caseware Affiliate may engage third-party Sub-Processors.</p>
            <p>Where Caseware engages a Sub-Processor in the provision of Services, a data processing agreement will be entered into with the Sub-Processor. A list of Caseware's current Sub-Processors is available in <b>Attachment 2</b>.</p>
            <p>Caseware will provide an updated list of Sub-Processors at least ten (10) business days before it is amended. Within ten (10) business days of an update to the list of Sub-Processors, Customer shall inform Caseware, in writing, of any objections to any appointment of a Sub-processor when Customer reasonably believes that such Sub-processor is not compliant with applicable Data Protection Laws, or such processing may present a risk to their Customer Information or Personal Data. In the event the Customer reasonably objects to a Sub-processor as described above, the Parties will endeavor to resolve the matter without undue delay. Caseware will use reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in Services to avoid processing of Customer Information or Personal Data by the objected-to Sub-Processor without unreasonably burdening Customer. CasewareCasewareCaseware If Customer objects to a new Sub Processor, even though the new Sub processor is necessary for Caseware and the Services, then Customer may terminate any subscription for the affected Caseware Services without penalty by providing, before the end of the notice period, written notice of termination.</p>
            <p>If use of a Sub-Processor involves a Restricted Transfer, Caseware shall ensure that the authorisation required under applicable law are at all relevant times incorporated into an agreement between Caseware and the Sub-Processor; and between the Sub-Processor and any Sub-Sub-Processor.</p>
            <p><b>12 Data Subject Requests</b>
            </p>
            <p>Caseware shall reasonably support the Customer in the case of a data subject access, rectification or erasure requests, insofar as Customer cannot fulfill such a request on its own, to the extent legally permitted and technically possible. Customers shall pay Caseware costs for such support, to the extent legally permitted.</p>
            <p>If a data subject request is received by Caseware that relates to Personal Data transferred by the Customer, Caseware will refer the request to the Customer. Caseware will not respond to such a request but shall instead support Customer as provided in this Section.</p>
            <p><b>13 Data Breach Notification</b>
            </p>
            <p>Caseware shall inform Customer without undue delay, and no later than 72 hours, after becoming aware of a breach of the Personal Data (meaning a breach of security leading to destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed), including a breach at a Sub-Processor, and shall provide the necessary information to allow Customer to inform authorities and data subjects. Caseware shall take reasonable efforts to remediate the cause of such data breach and mitigate (potential) damage resulting from the breach.</p>
            <p>The notification to Customer will include at least a) the nature of the breach, b) the impacted data categories, c) the identified and potential consequences of the breach and d) the measures Caseware takes to mitigate the consequences of the breach. At the request of Customer, Caseware shall assist Customer in notifying the breach to a supervisory authority and/or the data subjects concerned .</p>
            <p><b>14 Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)</b>
            </p>
            <p>Upon request by Customer, Caseware shall provide reasonable assistance to Customer in conducting a DPIA, solely in relation to Caseware's processing of Customer's Personal Data and taking into account the nature of the processing and information available to Caseware and Sub-Processors. Customers shall pay Caseware costs for such support, to the extent legally permitted.</p>
            <p><b>15 Deletion or Returning Personal Data</b>
            </p>
            <p>Caseware shall, at the choice of Customer, irretrievably delete or return all Personal Data within 120 calendar days of termination or expiry of the MPSA with Customer, unless storage of the data is required by law.</p>
            <p><b>16 Information &amp; Audit Rights</b>
            </p>
            <p>Customers may obtain information on existing Caseware security certifications at <a href="https://www.caseware.com/security-certifications/">https://www.caseware.com/security-certifications/</a>. Upon Customer's request, Caseware shall make available to Customer, or a third-party auditor instructed by Customer, once a year, information regarding Caseware's compliance with this DPA and Data Processing Law, including onsite audits. Any audit may include Caseware submitting its data processing facilities, data files and documentation needed for processing Personal Data (and/or those of its agents, affiliates and Sub-Processors) to reviewing, auditing and/or certifying by Customer (or any independent or impartial inspection agents or auditors selected by Customer and not reasonably objected to by Caseware), with reasonable notice and during regular business hours. Before any information or audit is provided, the Parties shall mutually agree on the scope, timing, and duration of such audit.</p>
            <p><b>17 Restricted Transfers</b>
            </p>
            <p>Any transfer of Personal Data from the EU, Switzerland, the UK or the EEA to a country outside such areas that does not ensure an adequate level of protection as determined by decision of the EU Commission, or UK or Swiss regulatory authorities, will be subject to the applicable Standard Contractual Clauses (or applicable equivalent promulgated by the UK or Swiss regulatory authorities), at Attachment 3 and any transfer of Personal Data from the UK or Switzerland to a country that does not ensure an adequate level of protection as determined by decision of the EU, UK, or Swiss regulatory authorities , will be subject to the applicable equivalent to the SCCs used at the time, including the UK International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses, at <b>Attachment 4</b>.</p>
            <p>Customers transferring Personal Data from the EU, Switzerland, the EEA or the UK to Caseware will be considered a "<b>Data Exporter</b>", and Caseware will be considered a "<b>Data Importer</b>" (both terms as defined in the Standard Contractual Clauses). Customer (as "<b>data exporter</b>") and Caseware (as "<b>data importer</b>") hereby enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses or the UK International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses, as applicable, in respect of any Restricted Transfer from Customer to Caseware.</p>
            <p>The Standard Contractual Clauses or the equivalent Swiss or UK International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses, as applicable, shall come into effect upon execution of the MPSA.</p>

            <p><b>Data protection safeguards</b>
            </p>
            <p>The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.</p>
            <p>8.1 Instructions</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>
                    <p>The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>8.2 Purpose limitation</p>
            <p>The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.</p>
            <p>8.3 Transparency</p>
            <p>On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>
            <p>8.4 Accuracy</p>
            <p>If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.</p>
            <p>8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data</p>
            <p>Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).</p>

                    <p>The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter "personal data breach"). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.</p>

            <p>8.8 Onward transfers</p>
            <p>The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter "onward transfer") if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:</p>
