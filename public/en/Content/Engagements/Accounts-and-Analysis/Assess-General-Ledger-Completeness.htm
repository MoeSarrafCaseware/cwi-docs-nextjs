        <h1>Assess General Ledger Completeness</h1>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This feature may not be available in your product.</p>
        <p>The <b>General Ledger Completeness</b> provides automatic validation, which helps you to quickly identify discrepancies in your trial balance or general ledger data.</p>
        <p>In an engagement you can navigate to the <b>General Ledger Completeness</b> tab from the <b>Data</b> page via the:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Link below <b>Assign Accounts</b> on the navigation pane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Link within the <b>General Ledger</b> grouping on the <b>Datasets</b> tab</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Link on the Documents page (which may not be available in your product)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The tab is always available if in a single entity or consolidated engagement. However, in a consolidated engagement, <b>General Ledger Completeness</b> will only reflect the trial balance and general ledger of the parent entity. If you are in an externally consolidated engagement, the links mentioned above are not available. To learn more about externally consolidated engagements refer to <a href="../File-Preparation/Create-an-externally-consolidated-engagement.htm">Create an externally consolidated engagement</a>.</p>
        <p>When first creating an engagement, the page will not have any data and will indicate as such on the page.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once data is imported and accounts are assigned, data will populate the <b>General Ledger Completeness</b> tab.</p>
        <p><b>To assess completeness of the general ledger:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Add your trial balance on the <b>Datasets</b> tab. Select the <b>Configure</b> button to assign the required fields. Ensure you add prior period balances and current period balances and that you include zero balances. To learn more, refer to the <b>Accounts not found in Trial balance</b> section under <b>Exceptions</b> below.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If you don’t assign prior and current period balances, you will get a <b>Data import issue</b> error message on the <b>General Ledger Completeness</b> page.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If both a trial balance and general ledger have been imported, but the general ledger is missing any of the three required fields, the <b>General ledger total amount </b>column displays a <b>Missing data</b> message. </p>

        <h2>Impact of the closing entry to Retained Earnings</h2>
        <p>The impact of closing the prior period’s net income to Retained Earnings will be reflected once you assign an account to a Retained Earnings group and an account to an Income Statement group.  The result is that the income statement account balances will become zero, and the Retained Earnings balance will reflect the opening balance for the period.</p>
        <h2>Calculation based on type of group</h2>
        <p>The calculation will be applied based on the type of group the account is assigned to:</p>
        <p class="indent">If Balance Sheet:</p>
        <p class="indent" style="font-weight: bold;">Current period calculated balance = Prior period balance + General ledger total amount</p>
        <p class="indent">If Income Statement, Net Income or Comprehensive Income:</p>
        <p class="indent" style="font-weight: bold;">Current period calculated balance = General ledger total amount</p>
        <h2>Exceptions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><u>Unassigned accounts</u>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent">Accounts that haven’t been assigned are displayed in this group with a warning message that calculations cannot be performed since the calculation is dependent on the type of group it is assigned to. Once the accounts are assigned, they will move out of this group and into a financial group above.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><u>Accounts not found in Trial balance</u>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent">Accounts that exist in the general ledger but not in the trial balance will show up in this group with a warning message that calculations cannot be performed.</p>
        <p class="indent">If the general ledger was imported but no trial balance yet, the accounts will appear in this group.</p>
        <p class="indent">If the aggregate total of the account in the general ledger is zero, and you did not import zero balances when importing the trial balance, the accounts will appear in this group.  Check off “Include zero-balance accounts” when configuring the trial balance file during the import process to prevent these accounts from appearing in this group.</p>

        <h2>Locked engagement</h2>
        <p>When you lock your engagement the link on the navigation pane as well as on the <b>Datasets</b> tab will no longer display.  If you unlock your engagement, these links return.
