        <h1>Date Entries</h1>
        <p>The Date entries analytic identifies transactions with certain date values. See the <a href="#Test">Test configurations</a> section to view a full list of the types of date values that can be identified.</p>
        <p>This analytic test can be used to identify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Possible attempts to manipulate the financial statements</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Financial reporting areas that have lower accuracy or precision</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Transactions that contain significant estimates</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Improperly configured system settings which may need improvement and further evaluation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Improper recognition of transactions in the correct accounting period</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Weak internal controls</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Weak monitoring and detecting activities</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Poor training</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Deviations in the expected date range which may indicate cut-off issues</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A long lapse of days between entered and posted dates or where the entered date is earlier than the posted date which could be an indication of back dating or forward dating</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A risk of material misstatement due to fraud</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fields used for analysis</h2>
        <p>The following fields are required for this analysis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Reference field(s)</b> - Unique field(s) that are used to create a unique transaction ID such as the <b>Entry ID</b> field for the general ledger dataset. These columns are not part of the result but are used to identify the transactions that are part of the result. This field is already defined in the test and cannot be modified.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Core field(s)</b> - One or two date fields.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>The following parameters must be set to run this test:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Date</b> - Select one or more dates that the analysis will be performed on.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Entered time period</b> - If your test configuration looks for date ranges, enter the number of periods that will be used. For example, if you select 2 and you select <b>Weeks</b> as the period type and <b>Between as</b> the range type, the test will look for dates 2 weeks before and after your selected date.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Select period type</b> - Select the period type, such as days, weeks or months.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Range type</b> -  For some configurations of this test, you must indicate whether you are looking for transactions on dates before, after or between the specified date range.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical specifications</h2>
        <p>When you run the Date Entries analytic test, the following steps are performed to run the test:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If needed place any filters on the data in order that a subset is used for the analysis.  If no filter is placed, the analysis will be run on the entire data file. This step can also be performed as the last step instead of the first. Note that the ability to set filters is not currently available and will be available in later versions of the test.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Validate that the necessary reference fields have been selected. If fields have not been selected, then create a unique reference field. This step is only performed if specific fields have been selected. If all the fields are available, this step is not necessary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Obtain which configuration of the test will be performed:</p>
