        <h1>Generate a sample from Analytics Hub</h1>
        <p>Each analytic test in the Analytics Hub includes a sample calculator in the Test Parameters tab. This tool lets you generate Random, Attribute, or Monetary Unit samples. You can also apply Systematic sampling manually, without the calculator. Sampling helps you quickly gain insights from large datasets by analyzing a smaller, representative portion, whether you're working with structured data like client transactions or unstructured inputs such as natural language descriptions (for example, 'Monthly control = bank reconciliations are reviewed and approved by the Controller'). You can use sampling within an analytic test or as a standalone tool.</p>
        <h2 class="collapsible">Sampling methods</h2>
        <p>The following sampling methods are available:</p>
        <h3>Attribute sampling</h3>
        <p>Attribute sampling is a statistical method used to evaluate the frequency of a specific attribute within a dataset. Each attribute is binary, having only two possible outcomes:&#160;true or false, and is commonly used for testing controls or compliance. </p>
        <h3>Monetary unit sampling</h3>
        <p>Monetary unit sampling (MUS) selects records based on the monetary value of a specified column. Each monetary unit (for example, each dollar) is treated as a sampling unit, giving larger transactions a higher probability of selection compared to smaller ones. The sample size is determined by parameters, such as risk tolerances and confidence levels. This method is especially useful in financial auditing, as it focuses on transactions with greater monetary impact. MUS is applicable to both the general ledger and subledgers, offering a reliable way to prioritize high-value transactions for review.</p>
        <h3>Random sampling</h3>
        <p>Random sampling selects a randomly chosen subset of records from a dataset. This approach is useful for unbiased testing or validation processes, ensuring each record has an equal probability of being included in the sample. It can be applied to both the general ledger and subledgers.</p>
        <h3>Systematic sampling</h3>
        <p>Systematic sampling selects records at regular intervals based on a predefined frequency (for example, every 10th record). This method ensures an evenly distributed sample across the dataset and can uncover patterns or anomalies within a dataset. It is particularly effective for structured financial reviews and can be applied to both the general ledger and subledgers for identifying irregularities in transaction posting or trends in financial data.</p>
