        </ol>
        <p>Your adjusting entry is posted to the account or group. The data is immediately updated with the new values. You can view your adjustment on the <b>Adjustments</b> page, and apply filters if required.</p>
        <p>You can also post an adjusting entry by selecting <b>Duplicate</b> for an existing adjustment to create a copy of it.</p>
        <p>When you duplicate an adjustment, the new adjustment has the same type, description, and account details as the original adjustment. Duplicate adjustments are set by default to the current year even if the original adjustment is for the prior year.</p>
        <p>Note that any annotations, issues or signoffs associated with the adjustment are not copied.</p>
        <h2><a name="Calculat"></a>Calculated adjustments</h2>
        <p>When you enter the adjustment amount, you can select <b>fx</b> to enter a calculation for the amount. You can reference other accounts and groups in the calculation, which allows you to create an adjustment that can be easily updated if the referenced account or group balance changes.</p>
        <p>If a calculated adjustment contains a reference whose balance has changed, the <b>Recalculate</b> button displays next to the adjustment on the <b>Adjustments</b> page. You can also easily recalculate multiple adjustments at once, by selecting the <b>Recalculate all</b> button at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/adjustments-page-recalculate.png" alt="The Adjustments page displaying an adjustment that requires recalculation." />
        </p>
        <p>When you create calculated adjustments, you must avoid creating circular dependencies. To do this, ensure you do not reference parent groups and accounts or groups whose final balance is also dependent on calculated adjustments.</p>
        <p>For example, if you make an adjustment to the <i>Petty Cash</i> account and reference its parent group, <i>Cash and cash equivalents</i>, in the calculation, you will create a circular dependency. When the adjustment is calculated and applied to the <i>Petty Cash</i> account, the balance of the parent group will also change. This will result in the <b>Recalculate</b> button displaying for the adjustment. If you select to recalculate the adjustment, the parent group’s balance will again be updated and the adjustment will continue to require recalculation. This will result in inaccurate balances for both the account and the parent group.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/calculated-adjustment-circular-dependency.png" alt="An example of a calculated adjustment with a circular dependency. This adjustment is to the Petty Cash group but the calculation uses its parent group, Cash and cash equivalents." />
        </p>
        <p>Another example that could lead to a circular dependency is when you add a calculated adjustment to one group that uses an account balance from a second group, and then add another adjustment to the second group that uses the final balance of the first group.</p>
        <p>For example, say you add an adjustment to the <i>Petty Cash</i> account and reference the <i>Short-term investments</i> group balance. Now, if you add a second adjustment to the <i>Short-term investments</i> group that references the final balance of the parent group of the <i>Petty Cash</i> account, <i>Cash and cash equivalents</i>, you will create a circular dependency.</p>
        <p>If the <i>Short-term investments</i> balance changes, the adjustment for the <i>Petty Cash</i> account will require recalculation. This will result in the final balance of the <i>Cash and cash equivalents</i> group changing, which means the adjustment for the <i>Short-term investments</i> group will also require recalculation. Once this adjustment is recalculated, the first adjustment will again require recalculation and so on.</p>
        <h2><a name="Common"></a>Common adjustment types</h2>
        <p>Adjustment types include  normal entries, reclassifying entries, uncorrected entries, and tax entries. Here are some  examples of the most common adjustment types and a brief description.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Normal</b>: Use to update all relevant automatic documents such as journals, ledgers, trial balance, financial statements, and leadsheets. When updating from one period to another, including a year-end close, these entries are transferred from the adjustment column to the opening or preliminary balance column on the trial balance and leadsheet documents.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Reclassifying</b>: These are not recorded in the normal accounting records. However, they are recorded in all financial statements and working papers such as leadsheets. When made in any period other than the last period of the fiscal year, reclassifying entries are excluded from the accounting records. In this case, the entries to non-consolidated balances do not have to be reversed.</p>
                <p>Reclassifying entries made in the last period of the fiscal year get included in the next year's opening balances when either of the following choices is made during a year end close: Update next year's opening balance with consolidated or report. Those reclassifying entries then have to be reversed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Eliminating</b>: Use to prepare combinations or consolidations of divisions or companies. These entries appear in consolidated trial balances, leadsheets, and financial statement documents.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Unrecorded - Factual</b>: These represent factual misstatements that will not be recorded because of materiality or proposed entries that may be subsequently changed to a normal status. These entries appear on the Summary of Uncorrected Misstatements Document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Unrecorded - Projected</b>: These represent projected misstatements that are unrecorded based on the auditor's best estimates of misstatements in populations, usually derived from sampling. These entries appear on the Summary of Uncorrected Misstatements Document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Unrecorded - Judgmental</b>: These represent judgmental misstatements that are unrecorded based on differences arising from the judgments of management concerning accounting estimates, or the selection or application of accounting policies that the auditor considers inappropriate or unreasonable. These entries appear on the Summary of Uncorrected Misstatements Document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Tax - Federal</b>: These adjust the federal tax balance. They are not recorded in the normal accounting records. Use the trial balance, journal, and leadsheet documents to display the federal tax entries. If creating a Journal - Adjusting journal entries automatic document, any Permanent or Temporary adjusting entry displays in the Difference column of the report.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Tax - State</b>: These adjust the state tax balance. They are not recorded in the normal accounting records. Use the trial balance, journal, and leadsheet documents to display the state tax entries.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Tax - City</b>: These adjust the city tax balance. They are not recorded in the normal accounting records. Use the trial balance, journal, and leadsheet documents to display the city tax entries.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
