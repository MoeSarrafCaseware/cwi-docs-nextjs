        <h1>View and manage aggregated analytic test results</h1>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This feature may not be available in your product.</p>
        <p>Where there are multiple analytics tests attached to a single checklist procedure in your engagement, you can view the aggregate results. You can also filter them and view and set the status of each transaction that has been flagged by analytic tests.</p>
        <p><b>To view the aggregate results for multiple analytic tests:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the Documents page, navigate to a checklist procedure where multiple analytic tests have been linked. The <b>Analytics</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-analytics-test.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) appears next to any checklist procedures where an analytic test is available.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li value="2">Select the icon to view the test results: </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="indent">If multiple analytic tests have been linked to the checklist in your product, the Analytics Hub opens. If only a single analytic test is available for the procedure, a Results tab showing only results for that analytic test opens. See <a href="Run-analytics-tests-from-checklists.htm">View analytic test results for checklists</a>, for more information. </p>

        <h2><a name="Filter"></a>Filter aggregate data results</h2>
        <p>You can filter the aggregate results by clicking <b>Filters</b> and then in the Filters panel, making selections for any of the columns in the dataset. All the column filters use the CONTAIN operator, whereas the entire set of filters use the AND operator.</p>
        <p><b>To filter aggregate data results:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Filters.</li>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="2">On the <b>Filters</b> panel, make selections to filter the data in the columns making up the aggregate results data. The filtering conditions you can apply depend on the format of the data in the column you're filtering. For example, in a date column such as <b>Posting date</b>, you can filter by a range of dates. If the column contains numerical data, you might filter by numerical ranges or specific values.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="indent">The entire set of filters uses the AND operator.</p>
        <p class="indent">In the example below, transactions will be retained by the filter if</p>
        <p class="indent"><code>Checklist/Procedure =  `1-1 Data Reliability Checklist`&gt;</code> (any transaction line where Checklist/Procedure is set to the value `1-1 Data Reliability Checklist`)</p>
        <p class="indent">AND</p>
        <p class="indent"><code>Status = `Open`</code> (any transaction line where Status is set to the value `Open`)</p>

        <h2><a name="Set"></a>Set statuses of transactions flagged in analytic tests</h2>
        <p>The Aggregate results page lists all the transactions flagged in the analytic tests that were run. You have the option of setting a status to track each transaction that was flagged. All flagged transactions start off set to Open.</p>
