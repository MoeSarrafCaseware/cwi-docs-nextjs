        <h1>Disclosure</h1>
        <p>The <b>Disclosure</b> analytic package encompasses a series of tests that are designed to identify and evaluate critical financial relationships and transactions for proper financial statement disclosure. It focuses on detecting material concentrations in related party transactions, customer and supplier dependencies, and balances in accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP). It ensures transparency, highlights financial risks, and addresses potential vulnerabilities related to financial stability and liquidity.</p>
        <p>This analytic package can be used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Detect related party transactions and identify material balances for proper financial statement disclosure</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Highlight risks of revenue concentration and overdependence on specific customers for cash flow</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Assess the financial stability impact of major customers and identify potential liquidity vulnerabilities</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Highlight risks of overdependence on a limited number of suppliers or vendors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Assess the impact of major vendors on financial stability and sustainability</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Identify vulnerabilities in cash flow management and supplier relationships due to concentration in payables</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
