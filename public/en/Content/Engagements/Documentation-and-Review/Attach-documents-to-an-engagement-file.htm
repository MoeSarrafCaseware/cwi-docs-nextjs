        <h1>Attach documents to an engagement file</h1>
        <p>As you work on your engagement, you may need to include supporting documents in the engagement file. For example, any of the following files could be part of your engagement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Additional records in a spreadsheet sent by your client</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A pre-existing template for a client letter you want to add to new engagements</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A signed acceptance letter in PDF form sent by your client</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can add these supporting documents to your engagement file. Once added, you can access them at anytime to add annotations or make changes.</p>

        <p>The selected file opens in Word or Excel. This file is  connected to your engagement. This means if you make changes to a file and save them,  other engagement team members who open the file immediately see your changes.</p>

        <p>Note that due to Microsoft’s default security settings, macros are automatically disabled for Word and Excel files from the internet, such as files hosted in an engagement. If your account is managed by your IT administrator, they can manage your permissions through group policies for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/trusted-locations">trusted locations</a>. Otherwise, you can update your personal settings to re-enable macros.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To enable macros by default in Word or Excel:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>

        <h2 id="Working-in-PDF-documents"><a name="Access"></a>Access an added PDF document</h2>
        <p>When a PDF file is added to the Documents page, you can access the shared copy directly from the engagement. When you open a PDF document, the PDF viewer opens in your web browser showing the document.</p>
        <p>You can add annotations to uploaded PDF documents.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, you can edit PDFs in Adobe Acrobat using the <b>Copy file URL</b> option. Any changes you make are kept in sync in your engagement. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you are using Adobe Reader version, you might be prompted to <b>Save the location</b> of the document every time you open the PDF. To avoid this, disable the protection mode in Adobe Reader to remove the prompt to specify the location where the file should be saved on your machine.
