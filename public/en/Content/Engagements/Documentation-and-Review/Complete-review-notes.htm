        <h1>Complete review notes (issues)</h1>
        <p>When completing review notes you may be required to collaborate with other staff and client contacts. Whether you're assigned a review note from an engagement file or the engagement workspace, you can easily ping and tag other people on the item to get clarification or additional client information. </p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> In Caseware Cloud, review notes are referred to as <b>tasks</b> and are added to the engagement workspace (entities). In an engagement file (such as Working Papers), review notes are referred to as <b>issues</b>.</p>
        <p>Once complete, mark the <b>task as completed</b> or the <b>issue as resolved</b>. In an engagement file you also have the option to <b>clear the issue</b>, thereby removing the notice while maintaining the note itself.</p>
        <p class="bestpractice"><b>Best Practice:</b> It's better to create a review note (<b>issue</b>) from within the engagement file so that your team can have context as to which document, checklist, line or engagement requires attention. For general review notes, consider using the tasks feature in the engagement workspace.</p>
        <h2 id="Complete-review-notes-in-an-engagement-workspace">Complete review notes in a client entity</h2>
        <p>When assigned tasks from the engagement workspace (entity), you can respond and collaborate with other staff and client contacts to complete the work. When you're finished simply change the state of the task to <b>Completed</b>.</p>
        <h3 id="Comment-on-an-assigned-review-note">Comment on an assigned review note</h3>
        <p>If you need more information or context to clear an issue adequately or to update your supervisor on your progress, you can discuss the task with its poster.</p>

            <p>When you're assigned an issue, you will  be assigned to a specific document, document item or engagement. </p>
            <p>Once an issue is addressed, mark it as Resolved. You can also clear the issue after it is resolved or if the issue is not longer required.</p>
            <h3 id="Resolve-review-notes">Resolve issues</h3>
            <p>After completing your review, you can resolve the issue. You can resolve the issue from the Issue menu or from the associated document. Resolving the issue removes the notification on the issues icon, while maintaining the history of the issue in the engagement file.</p>

            <p>You can delete issues that are no longer relevant to the engagement. Note that you can only delete an issue you've created. Only an Admin user can delete issues created by other users.</p>
            <p>An Admin user has at least one of the following Cloud administrative roles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Admin</li>
                <li>Settings Admin</li>
