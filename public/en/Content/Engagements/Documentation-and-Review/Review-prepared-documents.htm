        <h1>Review prepared documents</h1>
        <p>Here is how to review prepared documents in your engagement.</p>
        <h2>Step 1: Locate the prepared documents
</h2>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Engagements</b> to open the Engagements page. The default tab selected on the page is <b>My Work</b>. Engagements where you've been <a href="../File-Preparation/Create-and-set-up-an-engagement-file.htm#Assign">assigned as preparer or reviewer</a> display on the page.</p>
        <p>Select an engagement to expand the details. Under <b>Document Status</b>, you can see a breakdown of the status of all the documents in the engagement file. If you see that there are <b>Prepared</b> documents in the file, this means that the preparer has signed off on documents, and they are now ready for review.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Select <b>OPEN</b> to start reviewing the prepared documents.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/engagements-document-status-prepared-open-engagement-1303x460.png" alt="Select Open at the top of the engagement details section." />
        </p>
        <h2 id="Review-prepared-documents">Step 2: Review the prepared documents</h2>
        <p>On the Documents page, each document is displayed with a sign-off icon. Documents that are ready for review will have the <b>Prepared sign off icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-signoff-prepared.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) in front of their name.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Open a prepared document and start reviewing it. As you review, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="../../Explore/Interface/CaseWareCloud-SE/Work-with-Review-Tools.htm">Work with Review Tools</a> to track document changes and balance checks</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="Add-review-notes-(issues).htm">Create</a>  issues to flag concerns or assign tasks</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="Complete-review-notes.htm">Complete</a> issues flagged in the various documents by the preparer</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 3: Sign off as reviewer</h2>
        <p>Once you have reviewed a document and you have determined that the content is correct, you can sign off on the document to indicate that it is complete.</p>
        <p><b>To sign off on a document:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>At the top of the document, select the Sign Off drop-down menu. The sign-off roles are displayed. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/documents-optimizer-sign-off-reviewer-role-1134x290.png" alt="You will see who signed off on the Preparer role and when the document was signed off." />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Sign off</b> beside the role you want to sign off on.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you sign off on the review, the document status is updated. Your name and the date are recorded in the document, and when you go to the Documents page, you will see that the icon now indicates that the document has been reviewed.</p>
        <p>
