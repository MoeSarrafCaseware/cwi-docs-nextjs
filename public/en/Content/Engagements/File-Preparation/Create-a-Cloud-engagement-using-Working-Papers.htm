            <p>Desktop engagement files require that you have the software installed on your computer. You can create the engagement file locally and then integrate it with Cloud to enhance collaboration and sharing.</p>
            <h2>Create the engagement file</h2>
            <p>Instructions for creating a new Working Papers engagement file are available <a href="https://documentation.caseware.com/latest/WorkingPapers/en/Content/Engagements/File-Preparation/Create-Files/Create-New-File.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <h2><a name="Publish"></a>Publish the file to Cloud</h2>

            </p>
            <p>When you are ready to work on the new file, you can publish it to Cloud.</p>
            <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Ensure that you have integrated your Working Papers software with Cloud. For more information, see <a href="../../Explore/Hybrid-Cloud/Integrate-Working-Papers-with-Cloud.htm">Integrate Working Papers with Caseware Cloud</a>.</p>
            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To-publish-a-Working-Papers-file.flsnp" />
            <p>You have successfully published your Working Papers file to Cloud. This creates a parent copy of the file on Cloud, and you can now share it with other staff members. The parent copy replaces the placeholder that was created when you first performed the year end close on the last year's file.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Once published, your team can create copies of the file to work on the new engagement. For more information about sharing the file, see <a href="../Planning/Share-a-Working-Papers-SmartSync-file-on-Cloud.htm">Share a Working Papers SmartSync file on Cloud</a>.</p>
            <h2>Assign staff to a Working Papers file</h2>
            <p>In most circumstances, staff will be assigned to Working Papers files based on their engagement team (For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../Planning/Check-staff-workload.htm">Create an engagement team</MadCap:xref>), but in some cases you may want to assign staff individually. </p>
