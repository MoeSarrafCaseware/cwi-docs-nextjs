        <h1>Define materiality</h1>
        <p class="note in line"><b>Note:</b> This feature may not be available on your product.</p>
        <p>You may need to consider material amounts for misstatements in the client file. Some online engagement products include a materiality document that can help you assess materiality as you work on the engagement. These documents are like forms where you can define thresholds for overall materiality, performance and trivial misstatements to keep track of benchmarks.</p>
        <h2 id="Completing-the-materiality-form"><a name="Complete"></a>Complete the materiality form</h2>
        <p>Some engagement files have a <b>Materiality</b> document where you can record the determination of materiality for your engagement. You will most likely complete this form before doing any other testing or work for your client.</p>
        <p><b>To complete the materiality form:</b><![CDATA[

        <h3>Planning and Revised mode</h3>
        <p>You can switch between <b>Planning</b> and <b>Revised</b> modes in the forms for both <b>Materiality</b> and <b>Component Performance Materiality</b>. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Planning</b> mode is used during the drafting stage of your single or group audit. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Revised</b> mode is used at the end of the audit when comparing prior and current materiality. This mode will provide an additional column in the <b>Component performance materiality</b> tab for <b>Final performance materiality</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have completed the materiality form. During the course of your engagement, you can <a href="../Accounts-and-Analysis/Assign-accounts-to-groups-in-the-Data-page.htm">review material groups and accounts in the trial balance</a>. </p>
