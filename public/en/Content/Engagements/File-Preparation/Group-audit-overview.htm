        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Note-this-feature-may-not-be-available.flsnp" />
        <p>The group audit feature streamlines the use of common work areas within a group audit. This includes the ability to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Identify common work areas for various group audit components.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Share common work areas with component auditors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p MadCap:conditions="General.Ignore">Adapt common work areas to engagements with evolving statutory standards and complex requirements</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users can share or assign common work areas, such as Risks, during a group audit within the same engagement.</p>
        <p>This feature reduces manual data entry and inconsistencies in a group audit by enabling the group auditor to consolidate and track the work through Caseware Cloud.</p>
        <h2 class="collapsible">Definitions</h2>
        <p><b>component / component auditor</b> – A business unit whose audit an auditor or group of auditors is responsible for, or a group of auditors involved in a group audit.</p>
        <p><b>work area</b> – A common work area that auditors will use to complete an audit such as Risks, Controls, Documents, and Materiality.</p>
        <p><b>group auditor</b> – The lead auditor in a group audit and has the highest visibility and control over the group audit management.</p>
        <p><b>group hierarchy</b> – A table view of the group audit work categorized as parent and child components.</p>
        <h2>Group auditor workflow</h2>
        <p>The following demonstrates the workflow from the group auditor’s perspective.</p>

        <h2>Component auditor workflow</h2>
        <p class="note in line"><b>Note:</b> This section assumes the role of the component auditor.</p>
        <p>The component auditor is an auditor or group of auditors from a business unit assigned work within a group audit engagement. In Caseware Cloud the components are situated under the group audit entity to which the group auditor can assign work to the component auditor(s).</p>
        <h3>Fieldwork</h3>
        <p>Once assigned work has been sent, you will be able to open the component within the group audit and begin work. The name of the active component will be visible in the top left corner.  If a deadline has been set for this component by the group auditor, this will also be displayed in the top left corner.</p>
