        <h1>Sync a trial balance across engagements in different Cloud apps</h1>
        <p>You can use the same trial balance across multiple engagements in different Caseware Cloud apps. This feature is particularly useful for serving the same client in various engagements, such as auditing and financial reporting. For example, an audit team can seamlessly pass client data to a financial reporting team working in a different app and engagement.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p><b>Two different Cloud apps</b>: There should be at least two different Cloud apps, one as the source and the other as the destination. For example, Financials and Audit engagements apps. To import from an engagement file that belongs to a different Cloud app, you must have access to that app and the entity that the file belongs to. To learn more, refer to <a href="../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Review-security-settings-for-the-default-groups.htm">Set staff access levels.</a></p>
        <p><b>Source engagement</b>: The trial balance must be prepared and uploaded in the source engagement. Note that you cannot select consolidated engagements as source engagements.</p>
        <p><b>Destination engagement</b>: An engagement must exist in the Cloud app where you want to import data from a source engagement in a different Cloud app.</p>
