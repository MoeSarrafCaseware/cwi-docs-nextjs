        <h1>Viewing your assigned work</h1>
        <p>During the course of an engagement, the simplest way to see work assigned to you is by applying filters to the <b>Activities</b> page. In Cloud, work is represented by <b>tasks</b> assigned to you. You may also want to view any current <b>file requests</b> you've made to clients.</p>
        <h2 id="Reviewing-your-assigned-tasks">Reviewing your assigned tasks</h2>
        <p>You can use the activities page to review tasks assigned to you. </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To-view-tasks-assigned-to-me.flsnp" />
        <p>All of your current tasks are now listed on the Activities page. You can select any task to update its status or discuss it with other team members.</p>
        <h2 id="Reviewing-your-current-file-requests">Reviewing your current file requests</h2>
        <p>If you have made file requests of your client contacts, you can review the status of those requests from the <b>Activities</b> page using a filter.</p>
        <p><b>To view your current file requests:</b>
