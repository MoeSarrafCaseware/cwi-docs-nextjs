        <h1>Create a new engagement based on an existing file</h1>
        <p>You can create a new engagement based on an existing file. This allows you to take advantage of customizations you have made to a previous engagement so you don’t have to redo this work in a new engagement. Once the new engagement is connected, there is no further connection between it and the source engagement. Any changes you make in either engagement will only affect that engagement.</p>
        <p>The following information will be copied from the source engagement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Customizations to grouping structures</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Customizations to queries</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>External documents added to the engagement, such as PDFs and Microsoft Office files</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Customizations and responses to checklists</p>
            </li>
