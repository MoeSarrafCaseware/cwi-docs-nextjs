        <h1>Review the prior year's engagement</h1>
        <p>You are preparing to work on an engagement for a client who you've done work for in past years.  During the planning stage, you will likely want to review this client's old files.</p>
        <h2 id="Locating-the-prior-year-file">Locating the prior year's file</h2>
        <p>To begin, you can find the engagement file from the prior year by searching the Files page.</p>
        <p><b>To locate the prior year's file:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Viewer</i> role or equivalent rights for the client entity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select the appropriate Cloud page (such as <b>Working Papers</b> or <b>Other Engagements</b>).</p>
            </li>

            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/SectionRequiresWorkingPapers.flsnp" />
            <p>If your organization did publish the Working Papers file for the prior year, you should be able to find it here. You can open the file to review client documents from the last engagement.</p>

            <p>You have shared the prior year's file with your engagement team. They will be able to access the file for reference while they are working on the current year's engagement.</p>
            <h3>Reviewing materiality</h3>
            <p>In order to determine materiality for this year's engagement, you can review the materiality from last year.</p>
            <p><b>To review materiality:</b>

            <ol>

            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/SectionRequiresTime.flsnp" />
            <p>When you are getting ready to set a budget, you may find it helpful to review the costs associated with the engagement from the prior year. If your organization uses the <b>Time</b> app to track time and expense entries, you can run a summary report that displays these costs. The report parameters should be as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Type</b>: Time</li>
                <li><b>Format</b>: Summary</li>
                <li><b>Group by</b>: Work Code</li>
                <li><b>Staff</b>: All</li>
                <li><b>Entity</b>: (entity name for your engagement)</li>
                <li><b>Engagement</b>: (last year's engagement)</li>
                <li><b>From date</b>: First day of the last year</li>
                <li><b>To date</b>: Last day of the last year</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>To generate a summary Time report:</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Ensure that you have the <i>View all staff entries</i> permission.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Analysis</b>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>From the <b>Type</b> drop-down menu, choose <b>Time</b>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>From the <b>Format</b> drop-down menu, choose <b>Summary</b>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Set the other parameters for your report.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Select <b>Generate</b>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../../Resources/Images/analysis-generate-630x276.png" alt="Select the Generate button to run your report." />
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>You have successfully generated a report of Time entries for last year's engagement, grouped by work codes and subtotaled.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/analyse-summary-last-year-630x197.png" style="border:1px solid #3f66a3" alt="The total time and costs for all time entries on last year's engagement." />
            </p>
            <p>You can export the results of this report by selecting the <b>Export</b> button at the bottom of the left-hand pane. You can then run a report for expenses and another report for invoices, to compare your costs with the amounts billed to your client.</p>
