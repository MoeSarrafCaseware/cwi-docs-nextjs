        <h1>View and share financial statements </h1>
        <p>You can use the <b>Open link in new tab</b> or <b>Open link in new window</b> options to view multiple financial statements. The new tab or new window opens with the  currently selected area displayed.</p>
        <p>You can also share a link to a financial statement or a specific area in a financial statement with other members of the engagement team. For example, you can share a link to the Notes area in your financial statement to request a review from a team member.</p>
        <p>When you share the financial statement URL address with your  team, they can use the link to  open the financial statement.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To share a link to a specific area in the financial statement:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the financial statement and go to Document Map.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy and share the URL address.</p>
                <p>The link opens the financial statement with the area you selected in step 2 displayed.</p>
