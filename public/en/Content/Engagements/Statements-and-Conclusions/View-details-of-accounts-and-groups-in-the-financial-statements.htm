        <p>You can select a specific account in any financial statements table to view its trial balance data.</p>
        <p>To view account details, select the account to display the Account Details popup which shows the trial balance data for this account. Note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If you select a cell with overridden balance, the Account Details popup displays a highlighted line showing the original balance for that cell (the trial balance amount). To revert to the original amount, select <b>Revert</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-revert-to-inline.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />). To learn more, see <a href="../Accounts-and-Analysis/Review-group-and-account-balances-in-the-financial-statements.htm#Override">Override balances in financial statements</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If a rounding difference is applied to the account, the Account Details popup also displays a highlighted line showing the rounding details. To learn more, see <a href="../Accounts-and-Analysis/Review-group-and-account-balances-in-the-financial-statements.htm#View2">View rounding details in financial statements</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In consolidation engagements the Account Details popup displays an additional  separate column for eliminating adjustments.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This column is not available if you choose to view non-consolidated balances in the financial statements.
