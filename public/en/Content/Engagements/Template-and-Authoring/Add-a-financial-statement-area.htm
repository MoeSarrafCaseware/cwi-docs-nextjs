        <h1>Add a financial statement area</h1>
        <p>Areas help organize your financial statement content by grouping similar or related information. </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/se-to-add-an-area-to-the-financial-statement.flsnp" />
        <p id="contentBody">To add content to the new area, select <b>Add</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-new-area-inline.PNG" style="width: 19px;height: 19px;vertical-align: text-bottom;"></img>), then choose one of the following content types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Text Section</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Dynamic Table</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Analysis</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Page Break</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you add a content type, the content type appears in the area with a default title. For example, dynamic tables have Dynamic Table as the default title. You can edit this title to customize it and make it easier to navigate the financial statements.</p>
        <p> You can add more than one content type in an area. You can also drag and drop the new area to change its location in the document,  see <a href="Rearrange-areas-in-the-financial-statements.htm#Rearrang">Rearrange areas in the financial statements.</a></p>
        <h2>Client contact review – suggested edits</h2>
        <p>Your client contacts can now add suggested edits to text areas within documents. A suggestion button is now available to client contacts in the text section.</p>
        <p>You will have the option to accept or dismiss suggestions from a <b>Discussions</b> icon [<MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/icon-discussion.flsnp" />] that will be visible beside the text marked with a suggestion. In addition, a suggestion bar appears on the document map when the user has at least one suggestion to review and/or accept. With the bar, the user can view and manage suggestions that have not been addressed.</p>
        <p>This feature is available on all engagements for client contacts who have the <b>Contact-Viewer</b> permission for an engagement.</p>
        <p class="note in line"><b>Note:</b> Only the staff user can accept or dismiss suggestions</p>
