        <h1>Manage the enterprise firm template</h1>
        <p>As an enterprise firm author you typically need to perform the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Create a template</b> – Create your enterprise's customized version of the product template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Edit an existing template</b> – Modify  or update your template to reflect changes in standards or methodology or your users’ needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Revert to the product template</b> – Reset your template to the product template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Update your template</b> – Update your template with the latest changes from a new version of the product template.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This section provides instructions for performing these tasks.</p>
        <h2>Create a draft template</h2>
        <p>If you don't have an enterprise firm template or a draft, then your starting point is to create a draft.</p>
        <p>The following describes three common scenarios for creating a draft.</p>
        <h3>Do not customize the template</h3>
        <p>If you don't want to customize a template, you can set your enterprise firm template to use the enterprise template. The enterprise template contains the default content for your product.</p>
        <p>The advantage of using the enterprise template is that you don't need to manually update your template whenever there are new updates.</p>
        <p><b>To use the default template:</b>
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To get to Manage template settings.flsnp" />
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Use Default</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This option will not be visible if you already have an active template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The current template is archived and you now use the enterprise template.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage-template.png" alt="The user interface for template management for authors." />
        </p>
        <p>If you do not see the <b>Use Default</b> option, it means there is still an active draft. To return to the default:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Delete Draft</b> .</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Use Default</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Delete-draft-manage-template.png" alt="the user interface in template manage with options to delete a draft." />
        </p>
        <h3>Customize the template</h3>
        <p>If you want to customize the enterprise template to meet specific enterprise requirements:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To get to Manage template settings.flsnp" />
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Create Draft</b>. A new window will open with a new draft.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edit the draft. To learn more, see a list of customizable features under<b> Template setup:</b> <a href="../Authoring-index.htm">Authoring index.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Return to the original window.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In <b>Manage Template</b>, select <b>Publish As [version number]</b>. Your published draft becomes the new minor version of the enterprise firm template. The published draft is added to the archive, and a record of it is displayed in the archived templates list.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Revert or reuse a previous template version</h3>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> If there is an active draft, you must delete it before proceeding.</p>
        <p>You can create a new draft from any archived template, whether to restore a prior version or create a new draft. Previous versions are stored in the archive. Archived templates can only be opened if there isn’t an in-progress draft.</p>
        <p><b>To revert to a previous template version:</b>
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To get to Manage template settings.flsnp" />
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Go to the archived templates list.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open an archived template to create a draft based on that template. A new window will open with a new draft.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edit the draft. To learn more, see a list of customizable features under<b> Template setup:</b> <a href="../Authoring-index.htm">Authoring index.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Return to the original window.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In <b>Manage Template</b>, select <b>Publish As [version number]</b>. Your published draft becomes the new minor version of the enterprise firm template. The published draft is added to the archive, and a record of it is displayed in the archived templates list.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The published template is added to the archive and a record of it displays in the archived templates list.</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/archive-template-list-manage-template.png" alt="the user interface for accessing the archived template list in the Manage Template settings." />
        </p>
        <h3>Edit a draft template</h3>
        <p>You can edit the draft until you publish it.  This situation only applies if you have already created a draft.</p>
        <p><b>To edit the template:</b>
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To get to Manage template settings.flsnp" />
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Open Draft</b>. A new window will open with a new draft.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Your current template will be the one displayed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The template opens in draft mode. You can now make changes as needed.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Return to the original window.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Publish As [version number]</b> to have the changes applied to newly added engagements.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Delete a draft</h3>
        <p>You can delete a draft if you're not satisfied with your current draft. However, a template cannot be deleted once published. Older versions of a template are archived.</p>
        <p><b>To delete a draft:</b>
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To get to Manage template settings.flsnp" />
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Delete Draft</b>. You will return to the options to use the default template or to create a draft.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Update"></a>Update the enterprise firm template after a version release</h2>
        <h3>Minor version release</h3>
        <p>Your enterprise author typically releases a minor version of the product template on an ad hoc basis, that include minor fixes and changes. These updates affect all enterprises. Enterprise authors will then prompt the enterprise firm authors to accept these updates to the enterprise firm template.</p>
        <h4>Scenario 1: You do not use a customized template</h4>
        <p>If you do not use a customized template, no action is required. The new minor version will be applied automatically, and all new engagements will use the latest enterprise template version.</p>
        <p>Your enterprise author will notify you of the release. Once released, you should communicate the update to your users.</p>
        <h4>Scenario 2: You use a customized template</h4>
        <p>In this scenario, you have a customized enterprise firm template that will need to be manually updated. This will ensure that you retain your enterprise customization after updating.</p>
        <p>When your enterprise author notifies you of the release, once you accept the update and create a new draft, your existing enterprise firm customizations will automatically carry over to the latest minor version.</p>
        <p><b>To apply your customizations to a minor version release:</b>
        </p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> If a draft exists, you must publish or delete it before proceeding. An Update button will become available once either is done.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To get to Manage template settings.flsnp" />
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Click <b>Update</b> to receive the latest minor version of the enterprise template.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A new draft is created with the latest product updates and your saved template changes combined.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Publish this new draft to make this new minor version of the enterprise firm template available to your users.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/DateFormat/After a release update minor or major.flsnp" />
        <h3>Major version release</h3>
        <p>Caseware typically releases a new major version of the product template annually or when a significant number of updates are required. These updates affect all enterprises.  Enterprise authors will then prompt the enterprise firm authors to accept these updates to the enterprise firm template.</p>
        <h4>Scenario 1: You do not use a customized template</h4>
        <p>If you do not use a customized template, no action is required. The new major version will be applied automatically, and all new engagements will use the latest enterprise template version.</p>
        <h4>Scenario 2: You use a customized template</h4>
        <p>In this scenario, you have a customized enterprise firm template that will need to be manually updated when a new major version of the enterprise template is released to retain your enterprise firm customization after updating. This involves the following three major tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Migrate enterprise firm customizations from the previous product template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Review and test the migrated content within a specific timeframe provided by the enterprise author.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Publish a new version of the enterprise firm template for use by staff. The new version will include the changes made by the major version release and your enterprise firm’s template customizations.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To apply your customizations to a major version release</b>
        </p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> If a draft exists, you must publish or delete it before proceeding. A <b>Migrate from previous</b> button will appear once either is done. This button appears only if a new major version becomes available, and there is no draft in progress.</p>

        <ol start="3">

            <li>
                <p>Once changes and reviews of the template are complete, select <b>Publish As [version number]</b> to release a new version of the template. <b>You will be required to publish again to test your new version.</b></p>
