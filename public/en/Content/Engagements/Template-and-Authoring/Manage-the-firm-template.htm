        <h1>Manage the firm template</h1>
        <p>As a firm author you typically need to perform the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Create a template</b> – Create your firm’s customized version of the product template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Edit an existing template</b> – Modify or update your template to reflect changes in standards or methodology or your users’ needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Revert to the product template</b> – Reset the template to the product template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Update your template</b> – Update your template with the latest changes from a new version of the product template.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This section provides instructions for performing these tasks.</p>
        <h2>Create a draft template</h2>
        <p>If you don't have a firm template or a draft, then your starting point is to create a draft.</p>
        <p>The following describes three common scenarios for creating a draft.</p>
        <h3>Do not customize the template</h3>
        <p>If you don't want to customize a template, your users can immediately create engagements in your Caseware app based on the product template.</p>
        <p>The advantage of using the product template is that you don't need to manually update your template whenever there are new product updates.</p>
        <p>In the case that you have accidentally changed something in your template and created a customized firm template, you can revert back to the default.</p>
        <p><b>To revert back to the product template:</b>
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To get to Manage template settings.flsnp" />
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Click <b>Delete Draft</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <b>Use Default</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This option will not be visible if you already have an active  template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The current template is archived and you now use the product template.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage-template.png" alt="The user interface for template management for authors." />
        </p>
        <p>If you do not see the Use Default option, it means there is still an active draft. To return to the default:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Delete Draft</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Use Default</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Delete-draft-manage-template.png" alt="the user interface in template manage with options to delete a draft." />
        </p>
        <h3>Customize the template</h3>
        <p>If you want to customize the product template to meet specific firm requirements:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To get to Manage template settings.flsnp" />
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Create Draft</b>. A new window will open with a new draft.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edit the draft. To learn more, see a list of customizable features under<b> Template setup:</b> <a href="../Authoring-index.htm">Authoring index.</a></p>

            <li>
                <p>Return to the original window.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In <b>Manage Template</b>, select <b>Publish As [version number]</b>. Your published draft becomes the new minor version of the firm template. The published draft is added to the archive, and a record of it is displayed in the archived templates list.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Revert or reuse a previous template version</h3>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> If there is an active draft, you must delete it before proceeding.</p>
        <p>You can create a new draft from any archived template, whether to restore a prior version or create a new draft. Previous versions are stored in the archive. Archived templates can only be opened if there isn’t an in-progress draft.</p>
        <p><b>To revert to a previous template version:</b>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open an archived template to create a draft based on that template. A new window will open with a new draft.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edit the draft. To learn more, see a list of customizable features under<b> Template setup:</b> <a href="../Authoring-index.htm">Authoring index.</a></p>

        </p>
        <h3>Edit a draft template</h3>
        <p>You can edit the draft until you publish it.  This situation only applies if you have already created a draft.</p>
        <p><b>To edit the template:</b>
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To get to Manage template settings.flsnp" />

        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Your current template will be the one displayed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Delete a draft</h3>
        <p>You can delete a draft if you're not satisfied with your current draft. However, a template cannot be deleted once published. Older versions of a template are archived.</p>
        <p><b>To delete a draft:</b>
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To get to Manage template settings.flsnp" />

                <p>Select <b>Delete Draft</b>. You will return to the options to use the default template or to create a draft.</p>

        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Update"></a>Update the firm template after a version release</h2>
        <h3>Minor version release</h3>
        <p>Caseware typically releases a minor version of the product template on an ad hoc basis, that include minor fixes and changes. These updates affect all firms, especially those using customized firm templates.</p>
        <h4>Scenario 1: You do not use a customized template</h4>
        <p>If you do not use a customized template, no action is required. The new minor version will be applied automatically, and all new engagements will use the latest product  template version.</p>
        <p>Caseware will notify you of the release. Once released, you should communicate the update to your users.</p>
        <h4>Scenario 2: You use a customized template</h4>
        <p>In this scenario, you have a customized firm template that will need to be manually updated when Caseware. This will ensure that you retain your firm customization after updating.</p>
        <p><b>To apply your customizations to a minor version release:</b>
        </p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> If a draft exists, you must publish or delete it before proceeding. An Update button will become available once either is done.</p>

        <h3>Major version release</h3>
        <p>Caseware typically releases a new major version of the product template annually or when a significant number of updates are required. These updates affect all firms, especially those using customized firm templates.</p>
        <h4>Scenario 1: You do not use a customized template</h4>
        <p>If your firm does not use a customized template, no action is required. The new major version will be applied automatically, and all new engagements will use the latest product template version.</p>
        <h4>Scenario 2: You use a customized template</h4>
        <p>In this scenario, you have a customized firm template that will need to be manually updated when a new major version of the product template is released to retain your firm customization after updating. This involves the following three major tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Migrate firm customizations from the previous product template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Review and test the migrated content within a specific timeframe provided by Caseware.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Publish a new version of the firm template for use by staff. The new version will include the changes made by the major version release and your firm’s template customizations.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To apply your customizations to a major version release</b>
        </p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> If a draft exists, you must publish or delete it before proceeding. A <b>Migrate from previous</b> button will appear once either is done. This button appears only if a new major version becomes available, and there is no draft in progress.</p>
