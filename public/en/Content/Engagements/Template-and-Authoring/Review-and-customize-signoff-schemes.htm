        <h1>Review and customize signoff schemes</h1>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Custom sign-off roles and schemes are only available if they have been enabled in your product.</p>
        <p>Sign-off schemes are the applicable combination of preparer and reviewer roles required to sign off on a document. You can review and customize the sign-off scheme in the Document Properties dialog for any document type that can be signed off on, including the risk report and the risk assessment report. Note that you cannot sign off on queries.</p>
        <p>If you don't select a sign-off scheme for a document, the default sign-off scheme is applied.  You can modify this default scheme but you cannot delete it. See <a href="Set-up-signoff-schemes.htm">Set up signoff schemes</a> to learn more.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/to-review-and-customize-signoff-scheme.flsnp" />
        <p>Note that you can also review and customize the signoff schemes for risks from the <b>Risks</b> | <b>General</b> and <b>Risks</b> | <b>Assessment</b> tabs in the Product Settings. See <a href="Access-the-product-settings.htm">Access the product settings</a> to learn how to navigate to the product settings.</p>
        <p>With signoff schemes now in place,  the following takes effect in engagement files:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"></img>) | <b>Sign-offs</b> option is available to allow you to view signoff details and progress.</p>
            </li>
            <p>With this option enabled, you can hover anywhere next to the document name to display the gray pencil icons (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-signoff-on-hover.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) and sign off by selecting the icons. You can also select the hollow circle icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-signoff-for-documents.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) next to the document name to sign off. To remove your signoff, you can select the  (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-remove-signoff.PNG" style="width: 24px;height: 24px;vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
