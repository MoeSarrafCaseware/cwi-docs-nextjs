        <h1>Suppress content in the firm template</h1>
        <p>You can't hide or change visibility settings for the default documents or content that comes with your product. However, you can suppress it in the firm template so it doesn't show in  your firm's engagement files.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> To suppress content in the firm template, you must have the <b>Settings Admin</b> role or similar to access the firm template. For more information, see <a href="../../Setup/Security/Built-in-roles.htm">Built-in roles</a> and <a href="../../Setup/Security/Assign-system-wide-security-roles.htm">Assign security roles</a>.</p>
        <h2>Suppress a document in the firm template</h2>
        <p>If a document that's part of the default content that comes with your product is irrelevant in your engagement, you can suppress it.</p>
