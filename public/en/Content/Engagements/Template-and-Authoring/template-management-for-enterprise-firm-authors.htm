        <h1>Template management for enterprise firm authors</h1>
        <p>Every Caseware Cloud application begins with a product template. Your enterprise has customized this into an <b>enterprise template</b>. As an <b>enterprise firm author</b>, you use this enterprise template to create engagements for your firm.

        <h2>Template types</h2>
        <p>The <b>enterprise template</b> is created and managed by the enterprise author to enforce a standardized methodology across all firms in the accountancy network. It reflects an organization’s decision to centrally manage guidance and compliance.</p>
        <p>An <b>enterprise firm template</b> is a customized version of the enterprise template used by the enterprise firm authors under your global accountancy network.</p>
        <p>The following table provides a summary of the relationships between the various templates and authors in Caseware Cloud:</p>
        <h3>As an enterprise firm author</h3>
        <p>In Caseware Cloud, each type of template is managed by a different author. As a firm author, you will use the product template to create the firm template for your users  to create engagements.</p>
        <p><b>Responsibilities for firm authors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Template management:</b> Create, edit, and delete the templates your Caseware Cloud users rely on to create engagements.</p>

                        <p><b>Feature customization:</b> Change or add features within your template (for example, components, assertions, areas) to align with your organization’s needs.</p>
                    </li>

        <h3>Feature customization</h3>

        <h3>Release alignment: template lifecycles and versioning</h3>
        <p>The enterprise template undergoes continuous improvement life cycles, which include both minor and major updates. These updates are versions of the product template.</p>
        <p><b>Major versions</b>
        </p>
        <p>Major versions of the product template are created by your enterprise and updates all enterprise and firm templates.</p>
        <p>Major versions are typically pushed annually or when a significant number of updates are required. These updates affect all firms.</p>
        <p>Your job as an enterprise firm author is to accept the major version update and migrate all enterprise firm customizations to your new major version.</p>
        <p>For more information on how to accept and apply your enterprise firm customization to the latest major version, refer to: <a href="Manage-the-enterprise-firm-template.htm#Update">Update after a version release</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Minor versions</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>All authoring levels can release minor versions of their template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Minor versions released by Caseware push changes to the product template that are minor changes to be adopted across enterprises. Enterprise authors push these changes to the enterprise firm templates.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If your enterprise firm template is customized, accept the update when notified. A new draft will be created with your customizations carried over automatically.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you have an enterprise firm template that has no customizations, minor version updates will automatically be applied.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
