        <h1>Template management for firm authors</h1>
        <p>Every Caseware Cloud application has a product template configured to help your users create engagements according to industry standards. As a firm author, you can use the product template to enable your users to create engagements. You can also further customize the template, into a firm template, to fit your organization’s standards and requirements.</p>
        <p>To understand your role as a firm author, it's helpful to understand the different templates and your author role in Caseware Cloud.</p>
        <p>The following  illustrates the template management page and its features, including versions of the product template and action buttons for creating, editing and updating the template and related drafts.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Template types</h2>
        <p>The product template contains the default content for your product and is configured by Caseware authors according to industry standards and updated with the latest product features. Firm templates inherit the structure and content of the product template unless customized by the firm author.</p>
        <p>A firm template is a customized version of the product template.  It is used when your organization wants to apply its own standards to the product template.</p>
        <h3>As a firm author</h3>
        <p>In Caseware Cloud, each type of template is managed by a different author. As a firm author, you will use the product template to create the firm template for your users  to create engagements.</p>
        <p><b>Responsibilities for firm authors:</b>
