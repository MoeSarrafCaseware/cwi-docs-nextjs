        <h1>Copy Author IDs</h1>
        <p>You can copy the author IDs of predefined query questions. Predefined query questions are questions that have been authored in the <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Manage-the-firm-template.htm">product template</a>. Working Papers (WP) authors can use the author ID to set up a location in WP to receive files from a query document.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> You can only copy an author ID if you are customizing the firm template. To access the firm template, you must have the <b>Settings Admin</b> role or similar. See <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Manage-the-firm-template.htm">Manage the firm template</a> for more information.</p>
