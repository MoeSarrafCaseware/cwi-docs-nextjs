        <h1>Link a query question to a checklist procedure</h1>
        <p>You can link a query question to a related procedure in a checklist to complete the checklist document.</p>
        <p>For example, if there is a procedure in a checklist related to your client's business that you won't have an optimal answer to and it's better you request that information from the client, you can link the question to the related procedure in the checklist document. Once you collect the required information from the client, you can add the response in the checklist. To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Planning/Complete-a-checklist.htm#View">View client responses related to checklist procedures.</a></p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If the linked query question is hidden in the query document, its responses do not display in the checklist document.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To-link-a-query-to-a-checklist.flsnp" />
        <p>You can see the client response in the relevant checklist after staff have accepted it. If the client uploads a file as part of the response, the file displays as a link so you can access it directly from the checklist.</p>
