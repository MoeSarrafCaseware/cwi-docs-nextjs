        <h1>Review client progress and responses</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresPBC.flsnp" />
        <p>You can review responses and track the client's progress as they respond to the query. Notice how the time of the response and the name of the contact who has responded to each query question displays.</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/query-question-client-responded.png" alt="A query question with a response provided by the client." />
        </p>
        <p>Once the client contacts respond to all the questions in the query, its status changes to <b>Responded</b>. In the <b>Documents</b> page, notice how queries that have been fully responded have a blue pencil icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/contact-resoponded-toquery-icon-in-documents-page.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />).</p>

        </p>
        <p>You also receive an email notification once a client contact marks the query as responded. Open the query to start reviewing client responses.</p>
        <p>You need to review the contacts responses. If the information in a response is valid, you can accept the response. Select the <b>Accept</b> button at the bottom of the query question.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Complete-query-Tip.flsnp">
        </MadCap:snippetBlock>
        <p>You can also return a response back to the contact if the information or documents provided are insufficient, incorrect or need clarification. Select the <b>Return</b> button at the bottom of the query question.</p>
        <p>If the query question has the <b>Simple Electronic Signature</b> response type and the contact has accepted electronically, you can select <b>Download signature log</b> to review the signature details.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The Simple Electronic Signature response type is currently only available for letters.</p>
        <p>
