        <p>To request information such as the trial balance, financial statements, taxation assessments, or general entity inquiries you can create and send a new query by selecting <b>Create a document | Query</b>.</p>
        <p>After your contact provides the missing information, you’ll receive an email notification with their response. You can review their response and either accept or reopen the query.</p>
