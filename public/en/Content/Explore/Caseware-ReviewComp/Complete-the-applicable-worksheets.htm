        <p>CPA Canada has defined a number of optional worksheets in engagements. In the Fieldwork Optimiser, you can specify which worksheets you want to complete as part of the fieldwork tasks. At <b>Optional documents</b>, select <i>Yes</i> next to the worksheets you want to include.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once you select <i>Yes</i> next to a worksheet, it becomes available in the <b>Documents</b> page. <a href="../../Engagements/Planning/Complete-a-checklist.htm">Complete the available worksheets</a> and ensure that they're signed off by the designated roles.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> You can change the signoff workflow for a document by creating custom signoff roles and schemes. To learn more, see <a href="Modify-signoff-roles.htm">Modify signoff roles</a> and <a href="Modify-signoff-schemes.htm">Modify signoff schemes</a>.</p>
