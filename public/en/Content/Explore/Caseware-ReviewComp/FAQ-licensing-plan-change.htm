        <h1>FAQ: Caseware ReviewComp licensing plan change</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresRCT.flsnp" />
        <p>As of January 18, 2023, the Caseware ReviewComp license purchasing plan will change from <b>per engagement licensing</b> to <b>per user licensing</b>. This change will automatically be applied during your upcoming Cloud license renewal. To learn more, here are some frequently asked questions (FAQ):</p>
        <h2>New licensing plan</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>When will the new per user licensing plan for ReviewComp come into effect?</b>
                </p>
                <p>Effective January 18, 2023, you will no longer need to purchase packs of engagements for ReviewComp. During your next renewal, you will be able to purchase ReviewComp by number of users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Can I continue to purchase licenses using the per engagement licensing plan?</b>
                </p>
                <p>No, our licensing plan going forward will be on a per user license basis. Each licensed user will now have access to an unlimited number of engagements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>I do not require all of my staff members to access ReviewComp, how does the new per user licensing plan affect me?</b>
                </p>
                <p>On January 18, 2023, all existing ReviewComp Cloud users will have unlimited access to ReviewComp engagements, at no additional charge. The unlimited access for all users will cease at your renewal date, as you will automatically transition to the per user license plan. Four months before your renewal date, you will need to assign your staff members to ReviewComp, so the correct number of ReviewComp licenses will appear on your renewal.</p>
