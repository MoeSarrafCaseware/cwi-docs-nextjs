        <h1>Carry forward a Caseware Taxflow engagement</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/caseware-taxflow-vendors-note.flsnp" />
        <p>You can carry forward an engagement to re-use information, copying over answers from the prior year that have not changed.</p>
        <p>The carry forward process uses answers from the prior year when making decisions again in the current year. For auditors and accountants, this is often a time-saving utility where they accept all of last year's changes or only work on the individual items that have changed.</p>
