        <h1>What is Caseware PBC Requests?</h1>
        <p>Caseware Provided By Client (PBC) Requests is a solution that's exclusively designed to address staff-client collaboration. It offers a unified interface where you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Request information and documents from clients</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Track clients activity on each requested item</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Simply and effectively provide and receive feedback or comments</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Perform all the above within Caseware Cloud secure hub</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The default content that comes with PBC Requests can be used in client collaboration cases that are part of a Canadian assurance engagement. For example, gather information from clients as part of the annual assurance, review or compliance engagements.</p>
