        <h1>Get started with Caseware AiDA</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/aida-availability-proviso.flsnp" />
        <p>Caseware AiDA is an AI-powered digital assistant designed to enhance efficiency and provide dynamic responses to profession-specific enquiries. What’s more, AiDA when used in your Caseware Cloud app is context-aware, that is, AiDA can recognize the currently open document. In desktop apps, such as IDEA and Working Papers, AiDA offers prompt-based responses sourced from the knowledge base you select.</p>
        <p>Your interaction with AiDA is private and remains within your current session. AiDA does not share content or dialogue between users or use your firm's data to train its model. For answers to other frequently asked questions, see the <a href="../AiDA/AiDA-FAQ.htm">FAQ</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Before you begin</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Ensure your firm administrator has enabled Caseware AiDA. AiDA is enabled in the same way as any Caseware Cloud app. To learn more, see <a href="../../Setup/Security/Enable-AiDA.htm">Enable access to Caseware AiDA</a>. </p>
        <p>To use AiDA in Working Papers, see <a href="https://documentation.caseware.com/latest/WorkingPapers/en/Content/Setup/Environments-Configuration/Interface/CaseWare-AiDA.htm">Get started with Caseware AiDA (Working Papers)</a>.</p>
        <p>To use AiDA in IDEA:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Go to the <b>Home</b> tab in the IDEA ribbon and click the arrow in the Cloud entry in the <b>Caseware</b> group.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <b>Caseware AiDA</b> entry from the dropdown.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you haven't specified the Caseware AiDA URL yet:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Go to the <b>Home</b> tab in IDEA ribbon and click the arrow in the <b>Cloud</b> entry in the <b>Caseware</b> group.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <b>Caseware URL Options</b> entry from the dropdown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Caseware URLs tab of the <b>IDEA Options</b> dialog will open where you can specify the URL.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After setting up the AiDA URL, AiDA will launch in a separate window on the right side of the IDEA data grid. You can switch between the <b>AiDA</b> window and the <b>Properties</b> window using the tabs.</p>
        <p><strong>To get started:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In your engagement, select the AiDA icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/AiDAIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) on the right pane of the Documents page.  </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AiDA-Icon.png" alt="Selecting the AiDA icon on the Documents right pane to open it. " />
        </p>
        <p>AiDA appears to the right.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AiDA-New.png" alt="AiDA chat window" />
        </p>
        <p>With AiDA, you can</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#Summariz">Summarize engagement documents and PDFs (Cloud apps only)</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="#Ask">Ask AiDA questions</a>
                </li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2><a name="Summariz"></a>Summarize engagement documents and PDFs</h2>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> This feature is not available when AiDA is used with Caseware IDEA or Working Papers.</p>
        <p>AiDA can summarize documents within your engagement, including uploaded PDFs.  You can also have AiDA summarize scanned PDFs, also called image-based PDFs, which refer to PDFs where the text isn't editable and appears as part of the visual representation of the document. AiDA can summarize scanned PDFs by converting images into text. </p>
        <p>Summarize scanned PDFs in the same way as any other document in your engagement. </p>
        <p><b>To summarize a document:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On the Documents page, go to the phase or folder containing the document you want AiDA to summarize and select the document to open it. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/SelectDocToSummarize.png" alt="Selecting an engagement document for AiDA to summarize." />

            <li value="2">In AiDA, select <b>Summarize</b>.</li>

        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Summarize.png" alt="Selecting the Summarize option in AiDA." />
        </p>
        <p>AiDA provides a summary with references you can select to jump to the source material.</p>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="3">You can ask questions about the summary. Type your question in the text box and select <b>Send</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/AidASendIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</li>

        <h2><a name="Ask"></a>Ask AiDA questions</h2>
        <p>In the text box, type your auditing or accounting question and select <strong>Send</strong> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/AidASendIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
        <p class="indent">For tips on crafting good prompts for AiDA, see <a href="../AiDA/AiDA-FAQ.htm#Prompts">Prompts</a>.</p>
        <p class="indent">In general, provide as much context as you can. Formatting can be used, for example, line breaks and headings, to make your question easy for AiDA to understand. Below is an example of a question asking AiDA to brainstorm auditing procedures:</p>
        <p class="indent" style="font-style: italic;"><b>Context:</b> I'm identifying key risks for a new client in the e-commerce industry.</p>
        <p class="indent" style="font-style: italic;"><b>Question:</b> Suggest common risks related to sales transactions in an e-commerce environment.</p>
        <p class="indent" style="font-style: italic;"><b>Desired Response:</b> List of common risks specific to e-commerce sales transactions, for consideration.  All relevant risks in the resulting list can then be copied into the engagement file (e.g., Revenue Recognition - Risk of improper revenue recognition timing or amount, IT - Risk of system downtime or failures impacting sales ).</p>
        <p class="indent" style="font-style: italic;">

        <h2>Toggle between AI models</h2>
        <p>You have the option of selecting the AI model that best suits your needs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>AiDA Fast</b>: Based on the Claude 3 Haiku model, AiDA Fast is ideal for quick, efficient tasks. It provides fast responses with less processing power.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>AiDA Enhanced</b>: Based on the Claude 3 Sonnet model, AiDA Enhanced excels in complex tasks requiring depth and precision, such as detailed analysis and summarizing highly technical content.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To toggle between AI models:</b>
        </p>

        <h2><a name="Select"></a>Select a knowledge base and ask AiDA questions related to it</h2>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> When using AiDA with Caseware IDEA the only knowledge base available is IDEA Help.</p>
        <p>When interacting with AiDA, you can select a knowledge base and ask AiDA questions related to its information. By default, a knowledge base called <b>General Caseware Help</b> is available no matter the Caseware Cloud app you are using. In addition, an app-specific knowledge base named after the app in current use is also available for some apps. The <b>General Caseware Help</b> knowledge base derives its information from the Caseware Cloud Help Center at <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/">docs.caseware.com</a>.</p>
        <p><b>To select a knowledge base:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Scroll to the bottom of the chat window and click the <b>Knowledge Base</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/AiDAKnowledgeBaseIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the knowledge base that interests you. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the text box, type your question related to the app you are using (if you selected an app-specific knowledge base)&#160;or Caseware Cloud and click <b>Send</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/AidASendIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />). AiDA searches the selected knowledge base to find relevant information, processes it, and generates a response tailored to your query.</p>
