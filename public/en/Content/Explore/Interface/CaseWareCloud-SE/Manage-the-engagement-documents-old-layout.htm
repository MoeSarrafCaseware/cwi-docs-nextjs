        <h1>Manage the engagement documents</h1>
        <p>While working on your engagement file, you will complete many work programs, create letters, and submit client requests. All of the documents involved are displayed on the <b>Documents</b> page. </p>
        <p>Documents are grouped by the engagement stage they are completed in. Beside each of these high-level groupings a progress meter displays how much work has been completed for each stage as a percentage. Completion percentage is determined by how many documents have been reviewed and signed off. </p>
        <p>Within these high-level groupings, documents are also organized into folders. Folder names have a different font color, and you can select the folder name to hide or display all of the documents under it.</p>
        <p>Documents are displayed contextually: as you enter information in the planning documents, other documents relevant to your file will be added to the Documents page.</p>
        <h2 id="Create-or-upload-a-new-document">Create or upload a document</h2>
        <p>To add a document to the client file, select the <b>Add Document icon</b> (<img src="../../../Resources/Images/icon-document-add-dropdown.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) beside the high-level grouping. This button is also displayed when you hover over folders, enabling you to add documents directly to the proper folder.</p>
        <p>You can choose one of the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Create a new document</b> - choose one of the built-in document types to add it to your client file. You can also create new folders to organize your documents page, or create <b>placeholder</b> documents to represent files that you will add later in the engagement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Upload a file</b> - upload a file from your computer to the engagement file. See <a href="../../Getting-Started/Supported-software-and-hardware.htm">System requirements</a> for information on the supported MS Office versions.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> You cannot use drag and drop to upload files from your computer to a phase.</p>
        <h2>Replace external documents</h2>
        <p>You can replace external documents, such as PDFs, Word files and Excel files, that you have previously uploaded to the engagement.</p>

        <h2 id="Reorder-documents"><a name="Reorder"></a>Rearrange documents</h2>
        <p>You can move documents to different folders and subfolders to better organize your engagement content. The order of documents within folders and subfolders is determined automatically based on the document name and number.</p>

        <h2><a name="Locate"></a>Locate and access documents in the engagement file</h2>
        <p>You can access documents related to each task on the right panel of the engagement file. Similar to the Documents page, the right panel allows you to access all your documents grouped by engagement stage. Within the groups, documents are also organized in folders. When you open a document, your documents remain displayed in the panel for easy access.
</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/documents-page-new.png" alt="Document panel." />
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, you can use the following features in the right panel to help you locate specific information or documents for your engagement work:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Recent</b> - Access documents that you've opened recently. If you use one of the recent documents often while completing an engagement, you can select the <b>pin</b> icon (<img src="../../../Resources/Images/icon-pin-11x14.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) beside it to pin the document to the top of the panel for convenient access.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Search</b> - Search for visible documents based on the document name.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can open and close the right panel by selecting  the <b>arrow</b> (<img src="../../../Resources/Images/icon-chevron-right12x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) at the bottom or the (<img src="../../../Resources/Icons/docs-pane-top.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) icon at the top. Within the right panel, you can also expand and collapse the listed documents as well as the panel's other features by selecting the <b>arrows</b> (<img src="../../../Resources/Images/icon-chevron-up14X9.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) beside them.</p>
        <p>In addition to the document panel, you can use the search option in the top menu to locate documents. This option allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Search for documents based on the document name, number and content</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Search for other content, such as risks, controls and adjustments.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Matching results display as you enter a keyword for search.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Hidden documents and content are not included in search results.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/search-engagements-main-nav.png" alt="The search option in the top menu. Note that matching results display as you type the search keyword." />
        </p>
        <p>Once you've opened a document, you may see a list of its sections on the <b>Document Map</b> left panel, depending on the formatting applied to the document. You can select a section to jump directly to it. This saves you from having to scroll through a lengthy document, such as the financial statement, to view the relevant section.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/document-map-financial-statement.png" alt="The documents map is visible on the left" />
        </p>
        <h2><a name="Set"></a>Set up Bulk Print</h2>
        <p>In the <b>Documents</b> page, you can use the <b>Print (<img src="../../../Resources/Images/icon-bulk-print-option.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) | Bulk Print Settings</b> option to merge and print the documents as a single PDF file.</p>
