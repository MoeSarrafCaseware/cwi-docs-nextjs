        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure you have the <i>Admin</i> role or equivalent permissions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Cloud menu (<img src="../../../Resources/Icons/cloud-menu.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />), select <b>Settings | Organization | Business Units</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>New Business Unit</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter a name for the business unit. The content of this field will automatically generate a URL for the business unit. Do not modify this field after a business unit has been established with staff and entities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter a display label for the business unit. This is the name that will display to your staff. This field can be modified.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Save</b>.</p>
                <p>It may take up to 5-minutes to create the business unit. Do not navigate away from the page until it is complete (i.e. your cursor finishes its loading animation).</p>
            </li>

        <p>The business unit is created. Firm settings from your primary Cloud site are shared globally across all business units and modifications to them will update each business unit accordingly.</p>
        <p>The next step is to populate the new business unit by <a href="../../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Bulk-create-user-accounts.htm">importing staff</a> and <a href="../../../Setup/Organization/Move-entities-between-business-units.htm">moving entities</a> to it. </p>
