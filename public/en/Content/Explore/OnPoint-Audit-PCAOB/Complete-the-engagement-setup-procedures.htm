        <h1>Complete the engagement setup procedures</h1>
        <p>Most of the engagement work in OnPoint Audit PCAOB is completed via checklists. To set up your engagement, <a href="../../Engagements/Planning/Complete-a-checklist.htm">complete</a> the <b>1-200 Engagement set-up</b> checklist.</p>
        <p>The <b>1-200 Engagement set-up</b> checklist consists of a set of questions designed to determine the scope and nature of your engagement. </p>
        <p>As you answer questions in a checklist, additional documents populate on the <b>Documents</b> page. Only documents that you need are available, while other documents remain hidden. A link to the document that you need to complete next also populates as you respond to questions. To learn more about checklist documents, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Add-a-checklist.htm">Add a checklist</a>.</p>
        <p>You can view a list of the current documents in the engagement by selecting the folder icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/docs-pane-top.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />). A panel opens on the right side showing the available documents grouped by phase. You can also select a document to open it. Once you open a document, you can pin it for quick access using the pin icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-pin-11x14.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />). To learn more about functionality, see <a href="../../Engagements/Planning/Complete-a-checklist.htm">Complete a checklist</a>.</p>
        <p>To sign off on the <b>Engagement Setup checklist</b>, select <b>Sign Off</b> at the top-right corner of the document. To learn more, see <a href="../Interface/CaseWareCloud-SE/Manage-the-engagement-documents.htm">Manage the engagement documents</a>.</p>
        <p>Note that you can change the signoff workflow for the document and create custom signoff roles if needed.
