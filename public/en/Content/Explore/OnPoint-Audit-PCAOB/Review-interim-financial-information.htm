        <h1>Review interim financial information</h1>
        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) generally requires public companies to file quarterly financial information (Form 10-Q). This is also referred to as interim financial information, which describes financial information or statements which cover a period of less than a full year or a 12-month period which does not align with the entity's fiscal year (AS 4105.02).</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Each Q1-Q3 interim review should be created as a separate engagement file and rolled forward to create the next quarter’s engagement.  The Q4 review of interim financial information will be completed in the same engagement file as the audit.</p>
