        <p>The <b>Risk &amp; controls</b> page includes the controls report that you can access from the <b>Controls</b> tab. The report allows you to easily document controls by ensuring compliance and support for audit documentation requirements.</p>
        <p class="tip"><b>Tip:</b> If you’re working in another document and want to quickly add a control, select the <b>Add icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/add-id-icon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) from the top menu. To learn more, see <a href="Add-a-control.htm">Add a control</a>.</p>
        <p>The controls report allows you to view all documented controls in your engagement. You can also add, modify or remove controls from the report.</p>
        <p>When working in the <b>Controls</b> tab, you can assign assertions, link any identified risks, set the frequency of the control, and document whether a control should be tested and the result of its effectiveness.</p>
        <p>If there are no changes to a control from the prior period, the control will automatically be carried forward during a year-end close. To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Carry-forward-an-engagement.htm">Carry forward an engagement</a>.</p>
