        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The following known issues affect the in-progress engagements created between October 1, 2023 to February 21, 2024.</p>
        <h2>Queries</h2>
        <p>If queries have been utilized in your engagement,  note that any open queries will not carry forward to the newly created engagement.  Close all open queries before proceeding with the update process for in-progress engagements.</p>
        <h2>Financial reporting framework</h2>
        <p>In the <b>1-100 Engagement Acceptance/Continuance</b> document, the <b>Financial reporting framework</b> procedure has been updated from a multi-picklist to a picklist. If you have multiple selections, in addition to U.S. GAAP,  your responses will not be carried forward to the newly created engagement.  You will need to re-enter your response to this procedure and re-sign off in the new engagement.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The following known issue is not applicable to you if your in-progress engagement file was created after December 21, 2023, coinciding with the 2.1420.0 template version update.</p>
        <h2>Risk assessment in the Equity financial statement area</h2>
        <p>Under the Risk Assessment section of the <b>Risk &amp; controls</b> tab,  the <b>Equity</b> financial statement area has been split into <b>Equity - LLCs, Equity - Corporate</b>, and <b>Equity - Partnership</b>. The risk assessment for Equity will not be carried forward into the updated engagement. You will need to re-enter your risk assessment for Equity and complete your sign-off in the new file.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The following known issues affect the current version of OnPoint Audit.</p>
        <h2>Materiality form</h2>
        <p>In the <b>4-100 Materiality</b> form, the <b>Benchmark % applied</b> column and <b>Planning</b> fields cannot be modified.</p>
        <p><b>Workaround:</b> Change the materiality workflow status to <b>Revised</b>, then back to <b>Planning</b>.</p>
        <h2>AU-C reference hyperlinks</h2>
        <p>AU-C reference hyperlinks in OnPoint  Audit are currently not working due to a restructuring of the AICPA website. We are monitoring the issue as it’s being addressed by AICPA.</p>
        <p><b>Workaround:</b> For immediate reference, you can download the full text of all the AU-C sections <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/aicpa-statements-on-auditing-standards-currently-effective">here</a>.</p>
