        <h1>Firm Author</h1>
        <p>Firm authors are staff members with the <b>Settings Admin</b> security role or similar which allows them to customize the default content in the Cloud App their firm is using to meet specific firm needs. To learn more about security roles, see <a href="../../Setup/Security/Built-in-roles.htm">Built-in roles</a> and <a href="../../Setup/Security/Assign-system-wide-security-roles.htm">Assign system-wide security roles</a>.</p>
        <p>Firm authors need to create and manage the firm template, where they can  make the necessary customizations to the Cloud App they use to cater for specific firm requirements. See <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Manage-the-firm-template.htm">Manage the firm template</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>Firm customizations include adding content, set up a firm logo and modifying or suppressing the default content.</p>
