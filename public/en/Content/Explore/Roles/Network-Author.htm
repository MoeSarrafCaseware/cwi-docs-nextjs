        <h1><a name="Network"></a>Enterprise Author</h1>
        <p>The enterprise author role enables accountancy enterprises and associations, as well as large firms with multiple offices, to customize product templates provided by primary authors and share those templates with all their member firms. This allows accountancy enterprises to easily maintain a standard methodology across their member firms, while still giving member firms the flexibility to make further customizations as required for their region.</p>
        <p>To manage the enterprise firm template in a central location, accountancy enterprises will have a Cloud site specifically for enterprise authoring in addition to Cloud sites for each of the member firms in the enterprise. Users from the member firms that the enterprise wants to designate as enterprise authors can be added to the enterprise authoring firm site.</p>
        <p>The following topics describe some processes specific to enterprise authors:</p>
