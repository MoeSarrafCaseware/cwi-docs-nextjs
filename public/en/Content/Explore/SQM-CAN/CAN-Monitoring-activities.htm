        <h1>Monitoring activities</h1>
        <p>In the <b>MONITOR</b> module, the <b>Monitoring activities</b> tab is used to document the firm’s monitoring activities. These include the procedures implemented to ensure the firm’s quality management system is in compliance with the applicable standards in its design, implementation and operation.</p>
        <h2>Define monitoring activities</h2>
        <p>There are 2 types of monitoring activities:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Network monitoring activities</b> - These monitoring activities are prescribed by the firm’s network firm, where relevant. The network firm will distribute the prescribed monitoring  activities, which are then imported in Settings. The firm must assess their relevance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Firm monitoring activities</b> - These monitoring activities are recorded by the firm and are in addition to the network monitoring activities.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Modify monitoring activities</h2>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;Monitoring activities can only be modified if the status is in <b>Draft</b> mode. If a monitoring activity has already been accepted or reviewed, the sign-off must be removed before the monitoring activity can be modified.</p>
        <h3>To modify monitoring activity:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click on the <b>Expand</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/expand-.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) under the <b>Relevant</b> column.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/1 modify monitoring activity..png" alt="Modify monitoring activity. " />
                </p>
                <p>The monitoring activity will expand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-inline.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) and make the applicable changes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To save the changes made, select <b>SAVE</b>.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Delete monitoring activity</h2>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If a monitoring activity has been accepted or reviewed, the sign-off must be removed before the monitoring activity can be deleted.</p>
        <p>
            <h3>To delete monitoring activities:</h3>
        </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Network monitoring activities cannot be deleted.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click on the <b>Expand</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/expand-.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) under the <b>Relevant</b> column.</p>

        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If the monitoring activity does not apply to a firm, it will be marked as Not relevant. Non relevant  monitoring activities cannot be included in the monitored work program.</p>
        <h2>Sign-offs and approvals</h2>
        <p>Monitoring activities selected as relevant and signed off as prepared will be considered finalized and included in the monitoring work programs.</p>

        <h2>Complete monitoring activity</h2>
        <p>The monitoring activity dialog can be completed by either adding a new monitoring activity or by editing a monitoring activity from the list of monitoring activities already included in the table.</p>
        <h3>To add a new monitoring activity:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <b>Add</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/-Add.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) and select <b>Monitoring activity</b>.</p>

This extension  allows the person(s) performing the monitoring to perform the monitoring activity. This is especially important for monitoring activities that are performed at intervals only.
