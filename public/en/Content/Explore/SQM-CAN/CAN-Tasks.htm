        <h1>Tasks</h1>
        <p>In the <b>DESIGN</b> module, the <b>Tasks</b> tab is where system designers document the firm’s tasks, detailing the actions necessary to implement the firm’s policy responses.</p>
        <h2>Define tasks</h2>
        <p>There are 2 types of tasks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Network tasks</b> - These tasks are prescribed by the firm’s network firm, where relevant. The network firm will distribute the prescribed tasks, which are then imported in Settings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Firm tasks</b> - These tasks are recorded by the firm and are in addition to the network tasks.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Complete a task</h2>
        <p>To complete the <b>Task</b> dialogue, system designers can add a new task or  modify a task from the list of tasks already included in the table.</p>
        <p>To modify a task, see <a href="#Modify_a_task">Modify a task</a>.</p>
        <p>
            <h3>To add a new task:</h3>
