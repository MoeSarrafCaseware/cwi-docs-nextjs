        <h1>Review &amp; Publish</h1>
        <p>In the <b>DESIGN</b> module, the <b>Review &amp; Publish</b> tab is where designers can review and approve the firm’s draft system of quality management. Once approved, the system can be published for all users to implement.</p>
        <h2>Review the Draft SoQM</h2>
        <p>Review the draft system of quality management to verify the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Objectives are identified and documented.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Risks are identified and appropriately assessed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Responses are able to mitigate quality risks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Links between the objectives, risks, policy and procedure responses, tasks and monitoring activities are appropriate.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Only signed off items are reflected in the Draft SoQM and will be published to the firm’s system of quality management.</p>
        <p>The Draft SoQM will display each signed off objective, risk, policy and procedure response and task, along with their linked items.</p>

        <h2>Errors</h2>
        <p>Error notices will appear during the following instances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Objectives do not have risks linked to them or the linked risks are not signed off as prepared.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Risks do not have objectives linked to them or the objectives are not signed off as prepared.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Risks do not at least have either a policy or a procedure response linked to them or the linked policy or procedure response is not signed off as prepared.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Policy responses do not have risks linked to them or the linked risks are not signed off as prepared.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Procedure responses do not have policy responses linked to them or the linked policy responses are not signed off as prepared.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Tasks do not have procedure responses linked to them or the linked procedure responses are not signed off as prepared.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> All errors must be resolved before the Draft SoQM can be approved.</p>
        <p>To resolve an error see, <a href="#Resolve_an_error">Resolve an error</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="Resolve_an_error"></a>Resolve an error</h2>
        <p>To resolve an error, navigate to the tab under the <b>DESIGN</b> module that contains the error and add the relevant link.</p>
        <p>For example, if an error appears because an objective does not have a risk linked to it, you can solve this by either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Navigating to <b>Objectives</b> page and linking a risk to the objective.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Navigating to the <b>Risks</b> page and linking the relevant risk to that objective.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Warnings</h2>
        <p>Warnings can indicate incomplete data and do not necessarily  indicate errors in the Draft SoQM.</p>
        <p>Warning notices will appear during the following instances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Policy responses do not have procedure responses linked to them or the linked procedure responses are not signed off as prepared.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Procedure responses do not have tasks linked to them or the linked tasks are not signed off as prepared.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To resolve a warning, see <a href="#Resolve_a_warning">Resolve a warning</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="Resolve_a_warning"></a>Resolve a warning</h2>
        <p>To resolve a warning, navigate to a tab under the <b>DESIGN</b> module that contains the warning and add additional content and/or add the relevant link.</p>
        <p>Note that no action is required if the firm has intentionally not linked the items highlighted in the warnings, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Where a firm has designed a policy response, but there is no procedure response to action that policy response, then the warning for that policy response will remain in the Draft SoQM.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Where the firm has designed a procedure response, but the action will be taken outside of SQM there won’t be a task linked to the procedure response and the warning will remain in the Draft SoQM.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Approve the Draft SoQM</h2>
        <p>To approve the Draft SoQM, navigate to <b>DESIGN | Review &amp; Publish</b> and click on <b>Approve</b>.</p>
