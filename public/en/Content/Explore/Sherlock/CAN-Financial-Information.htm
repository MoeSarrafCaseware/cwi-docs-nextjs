            <p><b>Note:</b> Prior to using Sherlock visualizations for the first time, you must configure them using the options in the <b>Configuration</b> tab. Some examples of these options include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Current assets:</b> Specify the leadsheets that are classified as current assets.  These leadsheets will be used to calculate different financial ratios and generate graphs in Sherlock for benchmarking purposes. Note that leadsheets from Working Papers' default leadsheet listing are selected by default, but can be removed if they are not applicable.</li>
