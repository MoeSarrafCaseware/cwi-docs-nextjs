        <h1>What is Accomplish?</h1>
        <p>Accomplish is a job management app in the OnPoint Cloud Suite to help increase productivity and confidence in your firm's work. A column-based (kanban) layout shows your firm's work at a glance while draggable item cards allow you to organize and distribute work quickly and efficiently.</p>
        <p>Accomplish is fully integrated with other applications in the Caseware ecosystem. For example, Desktop Working Papers, Caseware Cloud engagement work, other engagements, tasks and activities can all be tracked in one place. Integration with PBC Requests and query functionality in our Cloud engagement apps means users can track client queries, and Caseware Cloud Time users can be notified of jobs that are at risk of running over time or budget through Accomplish.</p>
