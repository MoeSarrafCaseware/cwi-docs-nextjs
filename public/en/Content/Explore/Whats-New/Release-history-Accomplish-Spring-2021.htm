        <h2>French-language capabilities</h2>
        <p>Users may choose to work in Accomplish in French, using all the same functionality that is in the English version. Log in to Caseware Cloud in French to switch the Accomplish interface to French.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Calendar enhancements</h2>
        <p>Date selection for jobs and reminders is easier throughout Accomplish, with the introduction of a new calendar. This calendar prominently displays relevant dates based on the column you move a job card into.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Filtering</h2>
        <p>Accomplish’s filter capabilities have been enhanced with guidance on how filters relate to one another to ensure you only use filters that can be applied together. For example:</p>
        <p>
