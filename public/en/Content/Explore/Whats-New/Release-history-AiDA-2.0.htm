        <h1>What’s new in AiDA (v2.0)</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Caseware AiDA 2.0 release! This release introduces knowledge bases as a source of information for AiDA, summarization of scanned PDFs, source material references as well as a choice of AI models.</p>
        <h2>Toggle between AI models</h2>
        <p>You have the option of selecting the AI model that best suits your needs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>AiDA Fast</b>: Based on the Claude 3 Haiku model, AiDA Fast is ideal for quick, efficient tasks. It provides fast responses with less processing power.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>AiDA Enhanced</b>: Based on the Claude 3 Sonnet model, AiDA Enhanced excels in complex tasks requiring depth and precision, such as detailed analysis and summarizing highly technical content.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To toggle between AI models, scroll to the bottom of the chat window and click the AI&#160;Model icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/AIModelIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"></img>). Select the AI model of your choice. Type your questions and click <b>Send</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/AidASendIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"></img>).</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Knowledge bases</h2>
        <p>When interacting with AiDA, you can select a knowledge base and ask AiDA questions related to its information. By default, a knowledge base called <b>General Caseware Help</b> is available no matter the Caseware Cloud app you are using. In addition, an app-specific knowledge base named after the app currently in use is also available for some apps with a dedicated Caseware knowledge base.  The <b>General Caseware Help</b> knowledge base derives its information from the Caseware Cloud Help Center at <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/">docs.caseware.com</a>.</p>
        <p>To use this feature, scroll to the bottom of the chat window and select the Knowledge Base icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/AiDAKnowledgeBaseIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"></img>). Select the knowledge base that interests you.  In the text box, type your question related to the app or Caseware Cloud and click Send (<img src="../../Resources/Images/AidASendIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"></img>). AiDA searches the selected knowledge base to find relevant information, processes it, and generates a response tailored to your query.</p>

        <h2>Summarize scanned PDFs</h2>
        <p>You can also have AiDA summarize scanned PDFs, which are also called image-based PDFs. These PDFs refer to PDFs where the text isn't editable and appears as part of the visual representation of the document. AiDA can summarize scanned PDFs by converting images into text.</p>
        <p>Summarize scanned PDFs in the same way as any other document in your engagement.</p>
        <h2>View references to source materials</h2>
        <p>In AiDA’s answers to your interactions, AiDA now provides references you can select to view the source materials AiDA used to generate the response. References are not available if you have summarized a scanned PDF.</p>
