        <p>Find out what's new in Caseware Sherlock 6.1.</p>
        <h2>documentv2 and historyv2 datasets</h2>
        <p>We’ve introduced two new datasets — <b>documentv2</b> and <b>historyv2</b>. These datasets function similarly to the existing <b>document</b> and <b>history</b> datasets, but with users’ identities decrypted. This means that visualizations that would previously display an encrypted GUID to hide users’ names (with <b>document</b> or <b>history</b>) can now display their full names (with <b>documentv2</b> or <b>historyv2</b>).</p>
        <h2>Issue data from Cloud engagements</h2>
        <p>Sherlock now captures issue data from Cloud engagements and populates it into the same datasets as Working Papers. This enables you to query issue data across all engagements, regardless of their original platform.</p>
        <h2>Additional metadata from Cloud engagements</h2>
        <p>Sherlock now captures additional metadata from Cloud engagements, such as lockdown information, sign-off dates, materiality values and more.</p>
