        <h1>What's new - Caseware Sherlock 6.2</h1>
        <p>Find out what's new in Caseware Sherlock 6.2.</p>
        <h2>Business unit compatibility</h2>
        <p>Sherlock is now compatible with Cloud firms that utilize the business unit feature. This means that <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Move-Working-Papers-files-to-another-entity.htm#MoveBU">Working Papers engagements migrated to other business units</a> will now include the accompanying Sherlock data, which will automatically update with any incurred changes.</p>
        <h2>Document and risk data from Cloud engagements</h2>
        <p>Sherlock now captures document and risk data from Cloud Engagements and populates it into the same datasets as Working Papers. This enables you to query issue data across all engagements, regardless of their original platform.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This feature is temporarily unavailable until the next Cloud Engagements update.</p>
