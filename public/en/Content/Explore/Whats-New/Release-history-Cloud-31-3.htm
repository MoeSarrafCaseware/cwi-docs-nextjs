        <h1>What's new - Cloud 31.3</h1>
        <p>Caseware Cloud 31.3 adds APIs to integrate your firm’s external applications with Cloud, ensuring that your client data is always up-to-date.</p>
        <h2>API integration with external applications</h2>
        <p>Caseware Cloud now supports integration with external applications, such as CRM systems like Salesforce, MS Dynamics and more. This integration enables firms to easily transfer client data to Cloud, ensuring that it is always accurate and up-to-date. To get started, create an API client for the application in your Cloud site’s firm settings. For more information, see <a href="../Interface/Firm-Settings/Integration.htm">Firm settings - Integration</a>.</p>
        <h2>API tokens</h2>
        <p>Firm developers can generate API tokens to authenticate API integrations. This allows integrated applications to automatically retrieve new information without requiring a firm developer to manually trigger an update. To generate an API token, firm administrators must create an API client and provide the client ID and secret to the firm developer. For more information, see <a href="../Interface/Firm-Settings/Integration.htm">Firm settings - Integration</a>.</p>
        <h2>General enhancements and fixes</h2>
