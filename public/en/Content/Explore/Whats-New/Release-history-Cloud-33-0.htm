        <h1>What's new - Cloud 33.0</h1>
        <p>Caseware Cloud 33.0 features a new end user license agreement for client contacts, and major improvements to staff and group management for firms utilizing the business units feature.</p>
        <h2>All firms</h2>
        <h3>End user license agreement for contacts</h3>
        <p>Client contacts will see a new end user license agreement (EULA) on their next Cloud login. They must agree to the EULA terms before they can access Cloud content.</p>
        <h3>Contact email addresses</h3>
        <p>For security reasons, client contacts can no longer modify their own email address. This is now reserved for administrators or staff with the <b>Edit contact</b> permission.</p>
        <h2>Business unit enabled firms</h2>
        <h3>Centralized staff management</h3>
        <p>Administrators can now manage staff organization-wide using the new centralized <b>Global Staff</b> app. This enables administrators to make global changes to staff information, including assigned roles and business units.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="../../Setup/Organization/Manage-staff-across-business-units.htm">Manage staff across business units</a>.</p>
        <h3>Centralized group management</h3>
        <p>Administrators can now manage groups organization-wide using the new centralized <b>Global Staff Groups</b> app. This enables administrators to make global changes to groups, including assigned staff, roles and business units.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="../../Setup/Organization/Manage-groups-across-business-units.htm">Manage groups across business units</a>.</p>
        <h3>Organization and content roles</h3>
        <p>Roles are now divided into organization roles and content roles based on their scope. Existing system-wide roles (with the exception of the <i>Entity Admin</i> role) are now organization roles, which grant users permissions across all business units. Existing entity and content roles (with the addition of the <i>Entity Admin</i> role) are now content roles, which grant users permissions at the business unit level.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="../../Setup/Security/Built-in-roles.htm">Built-in&#160;roles</a>.</p>
        <h3>Cross-business unit entity selector</h3>
        <p>The entity selector now lists all entities that the current staff member has access to, across all business units. This enables staff to efficiently navigate between entities without the need to manually switch business units first. Additionally, staff no longer need to select a business unit on login, they will automatically connect to their last accessed business unit.</p>
