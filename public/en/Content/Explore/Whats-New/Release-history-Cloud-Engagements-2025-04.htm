        <h2>Cloud Connector Hyperlink tab</h2>
        <p class="note in line"><b>Note:</b> You need a license to Cloud Connector to use this feature. To learn more about Cloud Connector, refer to <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/How-to-get-started-with-Cloud-Connector.htm">Get started with Cloud Connector</a>.</p>
        <p>You can now automate the process of adding document URLs from an engagement to an Excel spreadsheet with Caseware Cloud Connector. The connector will enable you to see the current list of Cloud Engagement documents that are available from a URL and add the URL as a link to the spreadsheet. The link, rather than being a long URL string, will retain the same name as in the engagement.</p>

        <p>Cloud Connector ignores documents inside the engagement files that are hidden. To show documents hidden in the documents page, select the <b>Show hidden</b> filter to see all hidden documents. These hidden documents can be inserted as links into the Excel spreadsheet. In addition, Cloud Connector will update changes to the visibility or identifier IDs of documents within your engagement. Refresh or reopen Excel to update the links.</p>

        <h2>General user-experience improvements</h2>
        <p><b>Consistency in visual elements:</b> UI elements have been reviewed for consistency across the <b>Documents</b>,<b> Data</b> and <b>Risks &amp; controls</b> pages by standardizing icons, buttons and terminology. This includes ensuring annotation buttons are uniformly blue and updating tooltips for clarity.</p>
        <h2>Revert changes to default template for text sections or dynamic tables in financial statements</h2>
        <p>You can now revert the content of dynamic tables or text sections to their original state as they were when the engagement file was created. This new option is available in the More actions [<img src="../../Resources/Images/More action icon.png" alt="An icon for More Actions illustrated as three dots in a line." style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"></img>] menu, making it easier to restore the initial content if needed.</p>

        <h2>Shared trial balance support across different financial groups</h2>
        <p>This feature enables you to benefit from the efficiencies available with the sync trial balance feature, even when there are differences in financial grouping structures across apps. With this feature, you can share the same trial balance across multiple engagements in different Caseware Cloud apps. This feature is particularly useful for serving the same client in various engagements, such as audit and tax preparation.</p>
        <p>This has been developed specifically for use where a mapping relationship exists between the different apps. Firms will now benefit from the efficiency of being able to import one trial balance file, assign accounts once, and can then use that trial balance data across different Cloud apps without having to reimport trial balance accounts.</p>
        <p>To learn more, refer to <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Share-trial-balance-across-apps.htm">Sync a trial balance across engagements in different Cloud apps</a>.</p>
