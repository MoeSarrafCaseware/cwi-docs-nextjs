            <h1>New in Caseware Cloud Engagements 2025-05</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Cloud Engagements 2025-05! This release introduces improvements to the carry forward feature in financial statements, multilingual support for materiality and summary of misstatement documents, workflow improvements to Documents and Data pages and more.</p>
            <h2>Multilingual capabilities in Materiality and Summary of Misstatements documents</h2>
            <p>The next two feature enhancements are part of a larger initiative to expand multilingual support in Caseware apps.</p>
            <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> These enhancements are available only to new engagements.</p>
            <h3>Materiality document supports multiple languages</h3>
            <p>Firm authors now have multilingual capabilities in editable fields in the Materiality form. You can select a default language for your engagements and have the additional flexibility to change the language within editable fields.</p>
            <p>Editable fields that include multilingual capabilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Document and Sections Guidance</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Tables Headings</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Overall Materiality - Benchmarks Input fields in Tables (Custom formulas / Other)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Performance Materiality &amp; Trivial - % description</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Conclusion procedures (including conclusion for Group component allocation)</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Summary of misstatements supports multiple languages</h3>
            <p>Similar to the Materiality form, firm authors can now access multilingual capabilities in the Summary of misstatements document, specifically the <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Key Data</b> (input) fields.</p>
            <h2>Add selected financial groups, areas and cycles to the analysis tables</h2>
            <p>You can now include your own custom financial groups, areas and/or cycles for analysis within your Documents checklists. This can be done from the Analysis tab in your Documents checklist. You can modify the checklist settings to include custom financial groups, areas and/or cycles using the radio button for selection.  You can further specify the selection by expanding the dropdown under that category.</p>

            <h2>Filter the Documents page by document type</h2>
            <p>A new Document filter button[<img src="../../Resources/Images/Filter icon.png" alt="An icon for a document filter illustrated as horizontal lines forming an upside down triangle." style="width: 35px;height: 29px;vertical-align: text-bottom;" />] has been added to the document manager on the Documents page, allowing you to filter documents based on various criteria. What’s more, the filter menu dynamically updates based on the documents and their properties present, providing relevant filtering options as needed.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Letters/memos very similar; group them together</p>
                </li>

                        <p>Excel/CSV</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Other filter types include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Unsigned reviewer (at least 1 still unsigned reviewer signoff role)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Unsigned preparer (at least 1 still unsigned preparer signoff)</p>

            <h2>Assign cycles to financial groups</h2>
            <p>You can now assign cycles to financial groups from the Data page in their engagements. The ability to assign and see the cycle of a financial group allows users to address why certain groups are showing up in different lead sheets.</p>

            <h2>Carry forward improvements to financial statements</h2>

Carry forward is a time-saving utility that allows you to reuse information from a prior-year engagement in a current-year engagement. Settings, such as currency symbol types, can be carried forward either in bulk or you can select which changes to carry forward into the current engagement.</p>
            <p class="note inline"><b>Note: </b>This feature is available for new and existing engagements.</p>
            <p>All options in the following Document Settings can now be carried forward:</p>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> Document Settings for specific numbered heading options can be overridden at the Area level. Area setting changes do not carry forward.</p>
