        <h1>New in Caseware Cloud Engagements 2025-07</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Cloud Engagements 2025-07! This release introduces improved PDF editing capabilities and improved handling of partial trial balance imports. </p>
        <p>To learn more about the Caseware Cloud Engagements platform, refer to <a href="../Cloud-Apps/Caseware-Cloud-Engagements.htm">What is Caseware Cloud Engagements</a>?</p>
        <h2>Open and edit PDFs locally - now supported across Caseware</h2>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note: </b>This feature requires a one-time protocol installation and is only available for Windows users.</p>
        <p>The feature to open and edit PDFs locally, previously limited to select users, is now available across all Caseware applications.</p>
        <p>As part of this rollout, this feature includes a new in-house protocol, Caseware WebDAV, which improves installation and feature functionality. This updated protocol includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Reduced technical dependencies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A one-click workflow to open PDFs in your preferred editor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A streamlined installation process, including automatic detection of existing versions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Includes a simple prompt with direction on how to install the protocol and remove the previous version, if required.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To learn more about this feature, refer to <a href="../../Engagements/Documentation-and-Review/Attach-documents-to-an-engagement-file.htm#Open">Open and edit PDFs locally</a>.</p>
        <h2>Improved validations for trial balance imports</h2>
        <p>When some accounts in your trial balance don’t import—for example, because they duplicate existing accounts already present in the current engagement or fail other validations— a Partial data imported indicator now appears.</p>
        <p>This indicator shows that not all accounts were imported and provides options to address them:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/PartialTB-indicator.png" alt="Partial trial balance import indicator showing an existing account in the current engagement is duplicated in the import. ">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note: </b>This update does not address cases where a fresh import file (for example, CSV or Excel files) contains duplicate account numbers within the file itself. To learn more, refer to <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Import-the-trial-balance-from-a-CSV-or-Excel-file.htm?#Resolveduplicateaccountnumbersinthesametrialbalanceimportfile">Resolve duplicate account numbers in the same trial balance import file</a>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Export a list of duplicate accounts before continuing</b> (available only before accepting the import).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Accept the import</b> and proceed with the unique accounts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Reimport</b> after correcting the issue in the source file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Cancel and delete</b> the partial import from the <b>Datasets</b> tab to fix and retry.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This enhancement gives you clearer insight into import results and makes it easier to resolve issues before proceeding.

        <h2>Clearer messaging for server downtime and retry guidance</h2>
        <p>We’ve refined the error messages and retry options for cases when imports fail due to temporary system issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Request Timeout</b> errors now display guidance to retry after a short wait.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>503 Service Unavailable</b> errors now explicitly state that the server is temporarily unavailable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>Refresh</b> button is available to quickly reattempt the import.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These changes help you understand what went wrong, how to recover, and when it’s safe to try again, reducing frustration and avoiding unnecessary troubleshooting.</p>
        <h2>Fixes in Cloud Engagements 2025-07</h2>
        <p>Changes made by enterprise authors to the assertion names are overwritten by the primary author updates for multilingual support.</p>
