        <h1>What's new - OnPoint Audit Not-for-profit 2023 Release (v2.1420.0)</h1>
        <p>Here is what’s new in OnPoint Audit Not-for-profit 2023 release.</p>
        <h2>Not-for-profit content</h2>
        <p>OnPoint Audit now includes <b>Not-for-profit</b> specific content. You will now have access to Not-for-profit financial groupings, specific procedures and work programs to assist you in completing your engagements efficiently while remaining compliant with professional standards. The Not-for-profit content is driven by the organization type in your entity settings on Caseware Collaborate.</p>
        <p>To help complete your  account allocations with ease and accuracy, we are also introducing the new Dimensions Allocation worksheets. These include the <b>1-303 Not-for-profit dimension allocation worksheet summary</b> and the <b>1-304 Not-for-profit dimension allocation worksheet</b>, which can be accessed in the Financial data documents folder.</p>
        <p>In a subsequent release we will be introducing the Draft financial statements and note disclosures customized for Not-for-profit entities.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In addition to the Not-for-profit content, we have included the following new features and enhancements to existing OnPoint Audit content.</p>
        <h2>Multiple dimension categories for financial groups</h2>
        <p>In OnPoint Audit you can now  assign multiple dimension categories to a single financial group. This allows you to organize and present data in multiple ways in the financial statements. For example, you can have a dynamic table that breaks down your data by location, as well as a table that’s organized for fund reporting purposes.</p>

            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Both firm authors and end users also now have the ability to assign multiple dimension categories to a single financial group, as well as the ability to assign multiple dimensions to an account from the Account properties dialog. Note that while multiple dimensions can be assigned to an account, only one dimension per dimension category can be assigned to an account at a time.</p>

        <h2>Enhancements to financial statements presentation</h2>
        <p>To further enhance the presentation of the default financial statements, several improvements have been made, granting you expanded customization capabilities.</p>
        <h3>New Formatting options dialog</h3>
        <p>The Formatting options dialog is now available in the financial statements. This option allows you to customize font sizing, margins, text padding and indentations.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="https://developers.caseware.com/se-authoring/31/Customize-font-sizes-and-spacing-in-financial-statements.htm">Customize font sizes and spacing in the financial statements</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Table header print settings</h3>
        <p>The <b>Display column headings on subsequent pages</b> option has been added to the financial statements. When you select this option, dynamic tables larger than one page will display table column headings on each page the table extends to.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="https://developers.caseware.com/se-authoring/31/Set-up-the-print-options-in-the-financial-statements.htm">Set up the print options in the financial statements</a>.</p>

            </img>
        </p>
        <h3>Keep together paragraphs</h3>
        <p>The <b>Keep notes headings with paragraphs and keep paragraphs together</b> option is now available in the document print settings. Selecting this option ensures that note headings are not printed on separate pages from the note content and prevents paragraph splitting across pages, except when the paragraph is longer than one page.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="https://developers.caseware.com/se-authoring/31/Set-up-the-print-options-in-the-financial-statements.htm">Set up the print options in the financial statements</a>.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Headers for multiple page notes</h3>
        <p>In the Notes print settings, you can now select the <b>Display note headings on subsequent pages</b> option. When this option is selected, you can enter a custom suffix for headers for notes that span multiple pages.</p>
        <p>For example, if you enter the suffix “continued”, a note with the header “Significant accounting policies” will display as, “Significant accounting policies continued” on subsequent pages.</p>
        <p>Note that the suffix you enter is customizable for each language in multi-language templates.</p>

        <h2>Updates to PDF export of trial balance data</h2>
