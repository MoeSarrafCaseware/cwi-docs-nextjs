        <h1>What's new - OnPoint Audit Winter 2022 Release (v2.1130.0)</h1>
        <p>Here is what’s new in OnPoint Audit Winter 2022.</p>
        <h2>New controls report</h2>
        <p>To streamline your risk and controls reporting, we’ve enhanced and renamed the <b>Risks</b> page to the <b>Risk &amp; controls</b> page. The updated <b>Risk &amp; controls</b> page includes a new controls report that you can access from the <b>Controls</b> tab. The report allows you to easily document controls by ensuring compliance and support for audit documentation requirements are met.</p>
        <p>

        <h2>Annual tax export updates</h2>
        <p>The tax export feature now includes the updated 2022 tax exports and tax codes for the following tax vendors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Intuit's Lacerte© Tax</li>
            <li>Thomson Reuters UltraTax CS®</li>

        <h2>Improvements to content</h2>
        <p>Minor content improvements such as updates to authoritative references, changes to procedure wording and response types and the removal of irrelevant procedures, have been made to the following checklists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1-100 Engagement acceptance/continuance</li>
            <li>1-400 Initial audit engagement - Opening balances</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Enhancements to consolidation</h2>
        <p>A number of enhancements have been made to engagement consolidation to support more complicated consolidation hierarchies and circumstances where subsidiary entities do not require separate engagements.</p>
        <p>In Graph View, additional enhancements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A search box that allows you to easily find subsidiary entities.</li>
            <li>Updated designs for each subsidiary card.</li>
            <li>The ability to expand and collapse branches in the hierarchy.</li>
            <li>A link to the engagement file in the subsidiary card for subsidiary entities with its own engagement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A new Grid View option has also been added.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/ConsolidationHierarchyGridView.png" alt="Grid view within the consolidation hierarchy" style="width: 1073px;height: 227px;" />
        </p>
        <p>In addition to these changes, you can now use the <b>Add imported TB</b> option to create internal subsidiary entities for your parent entity and upload trial balance data without linking a separate engagement file for the subsidiary.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AddImportedTBOption.png" alt="Add imported TB option" style="width: 403px;height: 547px;" />
        </p>
        <p>To support these improvements, the following updates have also been made:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can now add adjustments for internal subsidiaries.</li>
            <li>The Data page has been updated to support filtering trial balance data for specific entities in the consolidation hierarchy.</li>
            <li>When you add a calculation from the Datalink dialog, you can specify whether the trial balance data linked is for a subsidiary, consolidated or for the parent entity.</li>
            <li>You can now create data link formulas that determine which data to use based on whether the document is set to use consolidated or non-consolidated data.</li>
            <li>You can now add a Total Consolidation column to dynamic tables to display the total consolidated balance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dimensions</h2>
        <p>A dimension is a group property. An account can be assigned to one dimension within a group for sorting and categorizing.</p>
        <h3>Create and modify dimensions</h3>
        <p>You can create and modify dimension categories from the <b>Dimensions</b> tab in the product settings, then populate the categories with dimensions. For example, you can create a dimension category named Location, then create a dimension for each location that your client has.</p>
        <p>You can also:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add third-level dimensions.</li>
            <li>Drag dimensions to reorder them within a category.</li>
            <li>Assign dimension categories to financial groups from the <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/MoreActionsIcon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) menu or the <b>Group properties</b> dialog.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firm authors can only modify dimension categories assigned to groups by other firm authors and end users.</li>
            <li>End users can only modify categories assigned by other end users.</li>
            <li>Firm authors and end users can’t modify dimension categories for groups that have inherited categories from higher level groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Add-dimensions.htm" title="Add dimensions" alt="Add dimensions">Add dimensions</a>.</p>
        <h3>Dimensions filter for financial groups</h3>
        <p>A <b>Dimensions</b> drop-down menu is available in the <b>Financial Groups</b> tab in the <b>Data</b> page to filter the financial groups by dimension categories.</p>
        <p>Note that for consolidated engagements, instead of a drop-down menu, there is a separate <b>Dimensions</b> view for the <b>Financial Groups</b> tab.</p>
        <h3>Dimensions in dynamic tables</h3>
        <p>To enhance the ability to use dimensions in dynamic tables, you can also  filter by dimensions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When inserting a trial balance row.</li>
            <li>When inserting a trial balance data link as part of a calculation in table cells.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Create Word and Excel documents</h2>
        <p>You can now create Word and Excel documents from within an engagement. To add a Word or Excel document,  select the Add icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/AddIcon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) from the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>

        <h2>Embed PDFs in financial statements</h2>
        <p>You can now embed PDFs in financial statements. Note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can add multiple Embedded PDF areas to the financial statements.</li>
            <li>Only one PDF can be uploaded to each Embedded PDF area.</li>
            <li>Once embedded, a PDF is included in the financial statement’s table of contents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hide header rows for dynamic tables</h2>
        <p>You now have the option to hide the header rows for individual dynamic tables in the financial statements. When a header row is hidden, it does not display in the financial statements or in the generated PDF when you print the financial statements.</p>
        <h2>Product updates in interactive Resource Center</h2>
        <p>We’ve added a Product Updates section to the interactive Resource Center where you’ll receive the latest updates and learn about new features at a glance. The Resource Center is also where you can access the guided walkthroughs available to you.</p>
        <p>To open the Resource Center from your engagement, select the blue information icon on the bottom right corner. When there’s a new product update, you’ll see a badge notification.</p>
