        <p>Here is a listing of what's new for the Caseware PBC Requests Spring 2021 release.</p>
        <h2>New Documents page layout</h2>
        <p>The <b>Documents</b> page has been redesigned to enhance the overall navigation and accessibility experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Phases are now aligned to the left of the page for quick access</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can replace documents by dragging and dropping an external document (PDF, MS Office documents, etc.) onto an existing document or by selecting <b>More Actions (</b><img src="../../Resources/Images/more-actions-inline.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" /><b>)  | Replace</b>. You can retain or remove pre-existing signoffs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The signoff icons now display in a row next to the documents</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="../Interface/CaseWareCloud-SE/Manage-the-engagement-documents-old-layout.htm">Manage the engagement documents</a>.</p>
        <h2>Enhanced review tools in checklists</h2>
        <p>Review tools in checklists have been improved to complement custom signoffs.</p>
        <p>If the <b>Modified since last review</b> option is turned on in the <b>Documents</b> page and you open a checklist that has been modified after reviewer signoff, the Review tools dialog opens automatically and the changes made since the last review display in the checklist.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If the <b>Modified since last review</b> option is turned off in the <b>Documents</b> page, users must manually turn on review tools in the checklist to view modifications since the last review.</p>
        <p>You can choose to view changes made since engagement creation instead of using the drop-down.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Review-and-customize-signoff-schemes.htm#Modifications">Review and customize signoff schemes</a> and <a href="../Interface/CaseWareCloud-SE/Work-with-Review-Tools.htm">Work with Review Tools</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Improved query layout</h2>
        <p>The query layout now features buttons available at the bottom of each question. Clients can select the <b>Submit Response</b> button to submit their responses to each question. Once they do, the button changes to reflect that a response has been submitted.</p>
        <p>The <b>Submit Response</b> button is also available to you so you can submit responses on behalf of clients who have provided responses outside of the query.</p>
        <p>When you review the query responses, you can use the buttons to <b>Accept</b> or <b>Return</b> each response. The status of each query question is also now displayed at the top right of the question.</p>

        <h2>Edit and delete comments in queries</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Timestamps for edited and deleted comments display in the Comments area</p>
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Query is sent to the contact</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Contact responds to the question</p>
