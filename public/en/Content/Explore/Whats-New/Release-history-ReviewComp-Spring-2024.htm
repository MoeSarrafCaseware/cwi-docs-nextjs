        <h1>What's new - Caseware ReviewComp Spring 2024 (v1.2898.0)</h1>
        <p>Here is a list of what's new for the Caseware ReviewComp Spring 2024 release.</p>
        <h2>Long-term debt worksheet</h2>
        <p>The <b>Long-term debt</b> worksheet is now available. In addition to automatically pulling balances from your imported data using Caseware Cloud Connector, this form also uses automated formulas to make it easier for you to track your principal and interest payments and long-term debt amounts.</p>
        <h2>Modify financial group names</h2>
        <p>You can now modify the names of financial groups from the <b>Data</b> page. Note that when you modify a group name, the name you enter will be used for the group regardless of sign changes and will override the consistent, contrary and inconsistent names of the group. You also have the option to revert changes from the Group properties dialog.</p>
