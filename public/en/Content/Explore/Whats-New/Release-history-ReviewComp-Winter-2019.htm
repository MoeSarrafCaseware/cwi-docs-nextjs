        <h1>What's new - Caseware ReviewComp  Winter 2019 (Version 1.329)</h1>
        <p>Here is a listing of what's new for the <b>Winter 2019</b> release of Caseware ReviewComp.</p>
        <h2>Corporate Tax certification</h2>
        <p>Caseware ReviewComp is now certified for the preparation of federal T2 and the Alberta AT1 tax returns to include corporations with year-end dates up to May 31, 2020.</p>
        <h2>Financial groups</h2>
        <p>We have modified the Financial groupings structure for better presentation. In the <b>Data</b> page, Financial groupings have been broken down further, so you can easily relate the Financial groupings in the trial balance to the groups in the income statement.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Analysis sheets</h2>
        <p>You can now choose how you want analysis worksheets to display in the Documents page. A new procedure is now available in the 3-00 Fieldwork Optimiser prompting you to select how you want to add analysis worksheets in the engagement.</p>

        </p>
        <p>You can choose whether to have all worksheets display in one folder (<b>Condensed</b>), in individual folders based on the corresponding financial area (<b>Individual</b>) or if you want to have both options (<b>Both</b>) - that is, to have them display in the generic folder and in individual folders as well.</p>
        <p>

        <h2>Content updates</h2>
        <p>We have incorporated a couple of updates to remain compliant with CPA Canada content for Bookkeeping services engagement letters and to complement the Corporation Tax only engagement workflow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If you're preparing a compilation engagement, a new procedure is now available in the <b>Planning Optimiser</b> asking if you want to prepare and share a Bookkeeping services engagement letter. If you answer <i>Yes</i>, the <b>300-BK Bookkeeping service letter</b> document becomes available in the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/300-BK.png" alt="The 300-BK document in the Documents page." />
                </p>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A sample engagement letter is now available for tax practitioners. If you're preparing a Corporation Tax only engagement, a new document <b>300-CT Corporate tax engagement letter</b> becomes available in the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Financial statements optimiser</h2>
        <p>To enhance the financial statements preparation experience, the <b>6-15 Financial statements optimiser</b> has been included in the workflow. The Financial Statements Optimiser encapsulates all procedures related to how you want to prepare and present the financial statements document in your engagement.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> With the Financial Statements Optimiser in place, the Planning Optimiser no longer includes procedures related to the preparation of financial statements.</p>

        <h2>Accounts</h2>

Note that if the account is assigned to a group that's linked to another group, it's automatically assigned to the linked group as well. </p>

        </p>
        <h2>Queries</h2>
        <p>Query documents have witnessed a few improvements to retain legacy behavior and improve scannability.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>To efficiently view and scan questions in queries, a filter now displays in the left side navigation in the document once it's sent to contacts.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Similar to the old query layout behavior, when you open a query document, its name now displays in the engagement's main navigation at the top.</p>
