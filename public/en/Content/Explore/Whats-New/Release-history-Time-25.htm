        <p>Here is a listing of what's new for version <b>25.0</b> of CasewareCloud Time.</p>
        <h2 id="billing-report">The Billing report</h2>
        <p>Determine your staff's productivity with the new Billing analysis report. The report displays an Effective Rate for each staff member, which takes into account both their billing amount and their write up/down amount.  By comparing a staff member's effective rate with their billing rate, you can determine where the most value is being added.</p>
