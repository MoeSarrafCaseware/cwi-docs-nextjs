            <p>Welcome to Cloud Engagements 2025-08! This release introduces improvements for tables of contents in Financial Statements and more. </p>

            <h2>New toggle for dot leaders in tables of contents</h2>
            <p class="note inline"><b>Note: </b>This feature is available for new and existing engagements.</p>
            <p>You can now disable or enable the dot leader from the table of contents of your <b>Financial Statements</b>. The default setting for the table of contents includes the dot leader. A toggle for showing or hiding the dot leader can be found in <b>Document Settings | Table of Contents Settings</b>. The dot leader will be removed from both the UI, the print preview and PDF output.</p>
            <h2>Show page ranges in tables of contents</h2>
            <p class="note inline"><b>Note: </b>This feature is available for new and existing engagements.</p>
            <p>You can now choose to display full page ranges (for example: “5–6” instead of just “5”) in the table of contents of your Financial Statements. This feature is available when a section spans 2 or more pages. Use the new toggle in <b>Document Settings | Table of Contents Settings</b> to enable this feature. When turned on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Sections spanning multiple pages will show the full range.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Single-page sections will continue to show just one page number.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This change applies globally across the entire document (no need to set it individually for each section).</p>
                </li>
