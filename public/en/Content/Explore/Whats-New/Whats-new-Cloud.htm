        <h2>Performance enhancements</h2>
        <p>This release includes several enhancements that align with our ongoing commitment to improve Cloud performance.</p>
        <h2>Deprecation of Google &amp; SharePoint integration</h2>
        <p>Due to the low usage of Google Drive and Microsoft SharePoint integration capabilities, these features will no longer be supported with this release. This change enables us to focus our efforts on solutions that provide greater value and long-term benefits to our entire user base.</p>
        <p>For more information, including how this may impact your workflow, see <a href="../../Setup/Administration-and-Settings/Google-Microsoft-integration-deprecation.htm">Deprecation of Google &amp; SharePoint integration</a>.</p>
