        <h1>What's new  - OnPoint Audit Summer 2025 Release (v2.2520.0) </h1>
        <p>We’re excited to introduce several updates in the Summer 2025 release of OnPoint Audit, designed to enhance consistency, usability and industry-specific support across engagements.</p>
        <h2><a name="Product"></a>New OnPoint Audit 2025 template</h2>
        <p>We’ve launched a new OnPoint Audit template as part of our broader effort to align with the rest of our product ecosystem—including OnPoint PCR, Caseware Taxflow, and Caseware DocuFlex. This standardization supports a more cohesive experience for firms using multiple products.</p>
        <div class="note inline">

                    <p>Existing engagements will not be affected by the new template.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

        <h3><a name="Industry"></a>Expanded industry content</h3>
        <p>Content for the following industries have been added in OnPoint Audit:</p>
        <ul>

        <h3>Authoritative reference cleanup</h3>

        <h3>Contrary rules group properties</h3>
        <p>We’ve removed the <b>contrary rules </b>group properties to simplify financial statement layouts. </p>
        <h2>New features and enhancements in Cloud Engagements</h2>
        <h3><a name="Enhancements"></a>Enhancements to the controls report</h3>
        <p>The controls report will now allow you to document information related to the Design and implementation and Operating effectiveness evaluation of controls.</p>
        <h3>Lockdown history as a PDF</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Lockdown-history-PDF.flsnp" />
        </p>
        <h3><a name="MapDimensions"></a>Map dimensions during trial balance import</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Map-dimensions.flsnp" />

        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/OnPointDimensions.png" alt="Selecting dimensions upon importing the trial balance." />
        </p>
        <h3><a name="General"></a>General ledger completeness</h3>
        <p><b>General Ledger Completeness</b> provides automatic validation, which helps you to quickly identify discrepancies in your trial balance or general ledger data.</p>
        <p>You can easily assess the reliability of your data through the automatic calculations provided on the <b>General Ledger Completeness</b> page. This new feature carries forward the prior period account balances as opening balances for the current period. Any changes during the period are added to the opening balances to get the preliminary ending balances. These balances are compared to what you receive from your client so that any differences are highlighted for follow-up.</p>
        <p>If the engagement is consolidated, <b>General Ledger Completeness</b> will only display for the parent entity.</p>
        <p>Built-in accessibility and usability features include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When the engagement is locked down, you cannot access the page, unless it is an internal link on the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Accessibility improvements to allow for appropriate keyboard navigation and screen reader support.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If an account is assigned to the Retained Earnings group, and accounts have been assigned to income statement groups, the page will reflect the prior period’s closing of net income (loss) to Retained Earnings.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Retained Earnings opening balance will include the net income (loss) from the prior period.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The income statement accounts’ opening balances will be reset to zero.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h3><a name="Risks"></a>Risks and controls copied across engagements</h3>
        <p>You can now copy risks and controls from an engagement into other engagements. Use the  <b>Copy from external engagement item</b> icon [<img src="../../Resources/Images/Icon-Copy-from-external-engagement-item.png" style="vertical-align: bottom;" />] in the top-right corner to copy data from another engagement into your current engagement. This feature supports consistency and reduces manual effort when preparing an engagement.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> This feature is available only in new engagements.</p>
        <p>After selecting the icon for <b>Copy from external engagement item</b>, you can select the engagement that contains the desired content. From here, you can</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Copy risks and controls from more than one engagement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy risks and controls from engagements within the same entity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy risks and controls from engagements from all entities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy risks and controls from engagements from all your Caseware applications.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy risks and controls from a component within an engagement.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you confirm a selected engagement, another dialog box will open to allow you to copy from that engagement’s <b>Risks</b> and <b>Controls</b>. Relationships between items will also be copied over. For example, from within the source engagement, if <b>Risk 1</b> has a relationship with a <b>Control 2</b> that will copy over into the current engagement. In the current engagement, you can adjust the data and relationships as needed.</p>
        <div class="note inline">
            <p><b>Notes about this feature:</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Copying risks and controls will not link the source and destination of the data; both can be edited independently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Copying will not override disabled features set within the destination engagement.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Checklists copied across engagements as PDFs</h3>
        <p>In addition to the above story on copying <b>Risks</b> and <b>Controls</b> from one engagement to another, you can now copy checklists, as PDFs, in a similar fashion. Checklists that are copied across other engagements are converted into PDFs and can be used as references for populating documents within a current engagement.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> This feature is available only in new engagements.</p>
        <p>To learn more, refer to <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Planning/Copy-content-from-other-engagements.htm">Copy risks, controls or checklists from other engagements</a>.</p>
        <h3>Final rounded balances for current year and prior year</h3>
        <p>You  can now see the <b>Current Year</b>’s final rounded balance and the <b>Prior Year</b>’s final rounded balance as two new columns in the <b>Accounts</b> table under the <b>Data</b> page. These numbers will match what is shown in the <b>Financial Statement</b>. This feature ensures alignment between your data and financial statements.</p>
        <p>The rounding conditions (for example, round by thousands vs millions) can be set from the <b>Engagement Settings</b> within the <b>Financial Statements</b>.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> This feature is available only in new engagements.</p>
