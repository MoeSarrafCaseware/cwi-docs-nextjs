        <p>The field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks could include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Reasoning: Applying logic and knowledge to solve problems and make decisions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Perception: Interpreting sensory inputs, such as visual, auditory, and other data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Language Understanding: Comprehending and generating human language.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Learning: Acquiring new information and skills through experience and data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Planning: Setting and achieving goals.</p>
