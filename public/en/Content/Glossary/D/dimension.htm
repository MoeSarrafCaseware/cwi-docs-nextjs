        <h1>dimension</h1>
        <p>A categorical attribute assigned to financial accounts to facilitate detailed and structured reporting. Dimensions enable users to classify and analyze financial data by various criteria, such as fund numbers or activity types, and are essential for efficient financial statement reporting. On a transaction register, the dimension would be an additional column of data.</p>
        <p>For example, users can import a trial balance where each account is associated with a fund number. For instance, the trial balance might include columns for <b>Account number</b>, <b>Account name</b>, and <b>Fund</b>:</p>
        <table class="table table-striped">
            <col />
            <col />
            <col />
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Account number</th>
                    <th>Account name</th>
                    <th>Fund</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>100.100</td>
                    <td>Cash</td>
                    <td>100</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>100.200</td>
                    <td>Cash</td>
                    <td>200</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>When importing this trial balance file, users can map the <b>Fund</b> column to a dimension category. This allows accounts with the corresponding fund numbers to be automatically assigned to the appropriate dimensions based on the dimension number and financial group setup.</p>
