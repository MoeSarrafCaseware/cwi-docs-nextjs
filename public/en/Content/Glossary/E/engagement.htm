        <h1>engagement</h1>
        <p>A specific project or task that an accounting firm undertakes for a client. This could be an audit, a review, a tax filing, or any other service that the accounting firm provides. In Caseware Cloud, an engagement can be thought of as a workspace for that project. Within an <a href="entity.htm">entity</a>, all related engagements are stored, including prior year completed engagements.  When a new engagement is created the start and end dates are defined for the engagement, and any relevant budget information is entered. The engagement is where all the work for that project takes place. It’s where you can manage documents, complete checklists, set deadlines and budgets and more.</p>
