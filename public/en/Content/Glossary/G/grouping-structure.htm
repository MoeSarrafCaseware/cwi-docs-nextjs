        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>financial grouping structure</b>. A hierarchy of groups that is used to categorize and arrange accounts in the trial balance or financial statements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>tax grouping structure</b>. A hierarchy of groups that is used to categorize and arrange accounts for tax purposes. A tax grouping structure resembles the tax codes applicable to your market.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>chart of accounts</b>. A hierarchical listing of each posting account in the trial balance. Certain Caseware Cloud apps may employ a standard chart of accounts that doesn't necessarily resemble the line items in the financial statements.</p>
