        <h1>Objective of the glossary</h1>
        <p>With this glossary, we aim to build an open knowledge base of business terms, concepts, and metrics in the context of Caseware Cloud. We aim to reach a general audience made up not only of seasoned accounting and auditing professionals but also of anyone internal to Caseware or new to accounting and auditing in a Cloud setting. The definitions you find here are not exhaustive, legal definitions. For those please see your local accounting or auditing standards body. We offer the terms defined here as part of a long-term content strategy where we strive to be as clear as possible with the terms we use to communicate and use the same terms consistently to mean the same things. </p>
