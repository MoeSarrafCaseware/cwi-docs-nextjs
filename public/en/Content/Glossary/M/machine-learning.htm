        <h1>machine learning</h1>
        <p>A type of artificial intelligence focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for each task. It involves training models on large datasets to recognize patterns and improve their performance over time.  There are two main types of machine learning: supervised and unsupervised.</p>
        <p><b>Supervised machine learning</b>: This approach involves training models to make predictions or decisions based on examples with known outcomes.</p>
        <p><b>Unsupervised machine learning</b>: This approach involves finding patterns and relationships within data without predefined outcomes.</p>
