        <h1>schema</h1>
        <p>In the context of Caseware Cloud, a structured framework that defines the organization and format of data within the platform. It includes metadata for each column that constitutes a table, specifying the data types, relationships, and constraints. This structured approach ensures that data is consistently organized and can be efficiently queried, analyzed and reported.</p>
        <p>For example, in Caseware Cloud, a schema defines the structure of a <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Understand-genledger-data.htm">General ledger</a> dataset, specifying columns such as <b>Account number</b>, <b>Account name</b> and <b>Posting date</b>, along with their respective data types (for example, text, number, date). A schema ensures that all imported data conforms to a consistent format, facilitating accurate financial analysis and reporting.</p>
