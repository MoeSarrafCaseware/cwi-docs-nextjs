        <h1>Data recovery limitations</h1>
        <p>If you need to recover files or data that cannot be <a href="Recover-a-previous-version-or-deleted-file.htm">restored from the Recycle Bin</a>, you can contact our support team to make a data recovery request. Data may be restored up to 90 days after the backup date.</p>
        <p>Caseware International restores backup client data for a fee dependent on the number of files restored. Depending on the amount of data required, there is a minimum charge of $85 per recovery request. The process may take a minimum of 24 hours for us to recover the files.</p>
