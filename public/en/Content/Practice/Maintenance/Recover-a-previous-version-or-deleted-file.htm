        <p>Caseware Cloud stores information on the Amazon Web Services Server infrastructure which may be located outside the country you are working from. Caseware Cloud utilizes Amazon Web Servers in the United States for the Americas, in Australia for Asia-Pacific clients, and in Ireland for other jurisdictions. All of your data, including backups, is in the same region.</p>
        <p>Caseware Cloud utilizes Amazon Glacier for backup storage. Glacier data is specific to a single region <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-data-model.html">[1]</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#glacier_region">[2]</a> and is not automatically replicated anywhere else. So, if you have legal requirements that your data must be geographically stored in Australia (for example), your data will only be stored there.</p>
