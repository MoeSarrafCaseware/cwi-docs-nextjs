                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Editor</i> role or equivalent rights.</p>

        <p>For a better audit trail, it may be more useful to post any related file discussion directly to a file. Also, users that do not have access to the entity but have access to the file can also see discussions and respond.</p>

        <p>If you need to contact a team member quickly, you can do so by using our built-in chat system.</p>
        <p>You can show or hide the Chat pane by toggling the Chat app icon.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/chat-630x56.png" alt="Chat icon" />
        </p>
        <p>You can open a chat window by selecting a person in the chat pane. When a person sends you a message, a minimized chat window is displayed at the bottom of your browser. You can also send a message to a person who is offline, and the message will be delivered when they sign in.</p>
