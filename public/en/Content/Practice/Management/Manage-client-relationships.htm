        <h1>Manage client relationships</h1>
        <p>During the engagement work, you can work directly with clients. For example, to request information or start a discussion with one or more client contact.</p>
        <h2><a name="Creating-activities-for-a-contact"></a>Create activities for a contact</h2>
        <p>Once your client contacts have been added to Cloud and your contact group for the engagement is set up, you may want to do some preliminary collaboration with the client.</p>
        <p>You can create a discussion and invite your contacts to respond. This verifies that your client group is working as intended and that your client contacts are able to access Cloud and respond to you.</p>
        <p><b>To create a discussion for contacts:</b>
