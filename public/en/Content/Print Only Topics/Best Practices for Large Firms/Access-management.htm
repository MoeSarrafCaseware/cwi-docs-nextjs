        <h1>Access management</h1>
        <p>In order to optimize site performance, ensure that staff members and contacts are only granted the access rights they need, and that they are not assigned multiple security roles on the same items. We also recommend using staff and contact groups to assign roles to make it easier to track users and assign them the appropriate level of access.</p>
        <h2>Manage staff access</h2>
        <p>When granting access to staff members, you should consider the scope of access each staff member requires.</p>
        <p>There are three levels of scope you can assign when you assign security roles: system-wide, entity-specific and item-specific. We recommend you keep in mind the following guidelines on role scope when you assign roles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Where possible, assign entity-specific roles instead of system-wide roles.</b>
                </p>
                <p>System-wide roles grant users access to all items across your Cloud site. If you have a large amount of data stored in your Cloud site, users with system-wide roles may experience slow loading times and decreased performance. In this case, you may want to consider granting entity-wide to users who do not require access to all items in your site to improve performance for those users. See <a href="../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Grant-users-and-groups-access-to-entities.htm">Grant users and groups access to entities</a> for more information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Avoid assigning item-specific roles.</b>
                </p>
                <p>Item-specific roles grant users access only on specific items, such as files or activities. Users with these roles will often experience slower performance compared to users with entity-wide roles, because in order to grant an item-specific role to a user, they must already have an entity-specific role for the entity the item is stored in. Granting users multiple roles on the same item often causes performance issues.</p>
                <p>Note that if you create confidential items within entities, users will require an item-specific role to access the item. We recommend you minimize the use of confidential items within entities to avoid performance issues.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Optimize role assignment</h2>
        <p>After you determine the level of access users require, you also need to ensure they aren't granted multiple roles on the same items.</p>
        <p>When you assign roles to users, consider the following guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Assign only the role with the highest level of access the user requires.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/non-optimal-role-assignment-1.jpg" style="width: 449px;height: 420px;" alt="The areas of overlap in this venn diagram indicate non-optimal role assignment." />
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        <b>Note:</b> The areas of overlap in this and the following diagrams indicate non-optimal role assignment.</i>
                </p>
                <p>For example, it's not necessary to assign a user the Viewer, Editor, and Owner roles on a file. The Owner role grants the highest level of access, so only that role is necessary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Do not assign users to groups with duplicate permissions.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/non-optimal-role-assignment-2.jpg" style="width: 508px;height: 358px;" alt="The areas of overlap in this venn diagram indicate non-optimal role assignment." />
                </p>
                <p>For example, staff members should not be assigned to two different staff groups that both grant the Owner role on the same set of entities or files.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Do not assign users system-wide, entity-specific, and item-specific roles on the same items.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/non-optimal-role-assignment-3.jpg" style="width: 421px;height: 399px;" alt="The entity owner role grants a user the highest level of access on files contained in the entity. Any permissions granted by item-specific roles are already covered by the entity owner role." />
                </p>
                <p>For example, if a user is assigned the Entity - Owner role for a specific entity, this role will give them Owner-level access to all items within the entity. It is not necessary to also assign item-specific roles to this user for all the items within the entity.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Restrict contact access</h2>
        <p>When granting access to contacts, ensure that you are only granting access to contacts who will need to log in to Cloud to respond to queries or file requests. If a contact does not need to log in, but you want to assign them to the entity to keep track of their contact information, you can assign them the <b>Associated</b> role on the entity. This role will ensure you can keep track of your contacts without granting them access to your Cloud site.</p>
        <h2>Best practices for Share Entity permission assignment</h2>
        <p>The <i>Admin</i>, <i>Entities Admin</i> and <i>Owner</i> built-in roles allow users to grant other staff or contacts access to an entity. In addition to these roles, you can also create custom roles with the <b>Share</b> permission for entities to assign users the ability to grant entity access. This custom role can be assigned to specific staff system-wide to manage all entities or at an entity level to manage specific entities.</p>
        <p>Note that users that are assigned roles with the <b>Share</b> permission are able to grant themselves and others all available permissions on the entity. These users are not limited to the permissions they are currently assigned, which means they have the ability to perform actions such as granting unauthorized access to themselves or other users, and deleting entities. In order to ensure users are not taking unauthorized actions, you can monitor staff activity.</p>
        <h3>Monitor staff activity</h3>
        <p>You can use the <b>Activities</b> app to monitor staff activity. When permissions are assigned to any user, a system activity is generated and can be viewed in the <b>Activities</b> app. A system activity is also generated when entities are deleted. See <a href="../../Practice/Maintenance/Check-system-and-file-history.htm">Check system and file history</a> to learn how to view system activities.</p>
        <h3>Subscribe to notification emails</h3>
        <p>In addition to using system activities to monitor activity, we also encourage the firm administrator to subscribe to events that may violate your company policy. For example, the firm admin can select to be notified whenever access to an entity is shared with a user and when an entity is deleted. See <a href="../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Change-notification-settings.htm">Change notification settings</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>The notification emails include links to view the system active details in Cloud. If you want more detailed information about the system activity to be included in the email, such as the entity name, you can enable <b>Detailed Notifications</b> in your email settings. See <a href="../../Setup/Administration-and-Settings/Customize-system---generated-emails.htm">Customize system-generated emails</a> for instructions.</p>
        <h3>Prevent deletion of entities</h3>
        <p>If you want to ensure entities cannot be deleted, a workaround is available with Caseware Cloud Time invoices to block the deletion of entities.</p>
        <p>Caseware Cloud does not allow entities to be deleted when the entity has pending unpaid invoices. In order to prevent entity deletion, you can set up a placeholder unpaid invoice for the entity. This invoice will prevent all staff from deleting the entity, even if they have the necessary permissions. We also recommend granting access to the Time app only to your firm admins. This will prevent other staff members from closing the invoice so they can delete the entity.</p>
        <h2>Use staff groups to manage entity access</h2>
        <p>We recommend using staff and contact groups to assign roles to make it easier to track users and assign them the appropriate level of access. Groups can be especially useful if you need to manage access permissions for a large number of staff members across different regions. Note that staff members will only be able to view and access entities they are assigned to. When you create and assign staff groups by region, you can ensure your staff members only have access to entities in their own region. This section will outline how to organize your staff groups by region and assign them to entities.</p>
        <h3>Import entities and assign tags</h3>
        <p>We recommend tagging entities by region so you can easily filter your client entities to find the correct entities and assign staff groups to them. You can create and assign tags to entities when you import them into Cloud.</p>
        <p>Cloud enables you to add multiple client entities in a single procedure using a .csv file or a block of delimited text.</p>
        <p>When using either method, ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each row represents one client entity, and</li>
            <li>Each column represents a property, such as their name, start date, and tags. To assign multiple tags, place the tags between quote marks and separate them with commas. Any tags that do not currently exist in Cloud will be created by performing the import.</li>
            <li>
                <p>The dates in the <b>Client Since</b> and <b>Inactive Date</b> column must be in the same format as the date format set in your personal regional settings.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend adding tags to your csv that match the  security groups (Country/Region) so you can easily filter your client entities and improve the efficiency of  assigning staff groups to them.</p>
        <p>In this example, an administrator wants to add two client entities:</p>
        <p>
            <i>Name, Location, Entity Number, Client Since, Fiscal Year End, Tags</i>
            <br style="font-style: italic;">
            </br>

        <h3>Create groups and assign staff</h3>
        <p>You can now create your staff groups and assign staff members to them.</p>
        <p>
            <b>To create a new group:</b>

                <p>From the sidebar, select <b>Members</b>. Choose the users you want to add to this group.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the sidebar, select Apps.  Choose the apps the users in the group should have access to.  You may choose all apps, or you may want to limit the apps to those that are specific to the region the staff are working in. </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Note:</b> For a staff member to be assigned to an engagement, they need to have access to the app the engagement is based on. If you want to ensure users in the group cannot create any engagements, deselect the <b>Create</b> checkbox for the apps you're sharing.</p>

        <h3>Grant access to a specific entity</h3>
        <p>There will be situations where you want to assign a specific person to an entity or engagement separate from the security groups you have created.  This would occur when you need to share an engagement from one country with a user that is based in a different country.</p>

        <p>You can also grant access to multiple entities simultaneously by selecting more than one entity. Note that if you grant access to multiple entities simultaneously, you can only assign one role for each group you select. For example, if you select entity A and entity B, then you can only assign the selected staff member the <b>Viewer</b> role on these two entities. You cannot assign Viewer on one entity and Editor on the other, for instance.</p>
        <h3>Add or remove users from a group</h3>
        <p>After groups are created, you can manage the membership of the groups by adding or removing users as appropriate.</p>
