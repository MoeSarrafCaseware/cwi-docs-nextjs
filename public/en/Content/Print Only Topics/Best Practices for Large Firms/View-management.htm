        <h1>View management</h1>
        <p>We recommend creating custom views to view engagement files and other data to ensure only relevant fields are displayed on the page. The less fields are displayed on the page, the faster the page will load. <b>We recommend adding a maximum of 5 columns per custom view.</b> You can also add filters to custom views to display items based on tags, workflow stages, and other criteria to further reduce the number of items that are displayed on the page. This will improve performance and ensure users only view relevant content.</p>
        <h2>Create a new view</h2>
        <p>You can create new views from <b>Settings</b>.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To-create-a-new-View.flsnp" />
        <p>The view is added, and can now be assigned to the desired user types.</p>
        <h2 id="Assigning-views">Assign views</h2>
        <p>After you have created a view, you will need to configure what types of users can access it or have it set as a default.</p>
