        <h2>Set up the tax engagement</h2>
        <p>The first step is to define the type of the engagement as a Tax engagement.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the <b>0-10 Planning Optimiser</b>, select <b>Corporation Tax only</b> beside <b>What type of engagement is being performed?</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the following link to open the <b>Tax Optimiser</b>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/start-tax-engagement.png" alt="Planning optimizer - select Tax optimiser checklist" />
                </p>
                <p>The <b>Tax Optimiser Checklist</b> displays. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/toc-tabs.png" alt="T-01 TOC Tax optimiser checklist" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Complete the document with the details of the entity you're performing the tax engagement for, as well as the characteristics of the engagement. You can access different sections by selecting the corresponding tab above the document.</p>
        <p>The engagement will automatically populate with the appropriate provincial and federal tax forms, as well as Caseware ReviewComp's worksheets. These documents will appear in the <b>Document Map</b> on the left panel. You can choose to complete the new documents as they appear with each answered procedure, or finish the checklist and complete the added documents later.</p>
        <h2>Import tax data</h2>
        <p>Caseware ReviewComp gives you a few different ways to import the engagement's tax data.</p>
        <p>Select <b>Import</b> to view the import options.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tax-import.png" alt="Import drop-down menu" />
        </p>
        <h3>Practice set 1- GIFI import</h3>
        <p>Select this option to browse your computer for a GIFI output file from your desktop accounting package.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This option should only be used if you are <i>not</i> going to use the Trial Balance as any change in the Trial Balance will first clear the GIFI forms and transfer the Trial Balance data into the GIFI forms.</p>
        <h3>Practice set 2 - TaxPrep CSV Import</h3>
        <p>Select this option to upload a .csv output file generated that was generated by TaxPrep.</p>
        <div class="nobreak">
            <p><b>Notes:</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do a roll forward in TaxPrep before doing the CSV file Export within TaxPrep.</li>
                <li>TaxPrep CSV Import will clear out all the data transferred from the Trial Balance into the GIFI and replace it with the data from the CSV Import. Therefore, you must  import this CSV file before you perform any imports into the Trial Balance. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p><b>To export a .csv file from TaxPrep</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select <img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-import.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" /> <b>| TaxPrep CSV</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Navigate to the desired file and select <b>Open</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Practice set 3 - T2 Auto-fill</h3>
        <p>If you've registered for the CRA's <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/about-t2-auto-fill.html">T2 Auto-fill</a> program, you can import the engagement's tax data automatically based on the client's previously filed returns. </p>
        <h3>Practice set 4 - Download CloudBridge</h3>
        <p>CloudBridge is an add-on for Caseware Working Papers that lets you link a Working Papers engagement to a Cloud entity to import your engagement's tax data into your Cloud apps. Use this option if you have a Working Papers engagement that contains GIFI data.</p>
        <p><b>To download CloudBridge:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>From <b>Data | Import from</b>, select <b>Caseware Working Papers</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Follow the instructions on the help page that appears to import your engagement data from Working Papers.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Complete the Tax Preparer profile document</h2>
        <p>The <b>T-02 TPP - Tax preparer profile</b> document requires you to enter key information about the entity performing the tax engagement.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tax-preparer-profile.png" alt="T-02 TPP - Tax preparer profile" />
        </p>
        <p>Once this document is completed and signed off , you're ready to begin your tax engagement work.</p>
        <h2>Complete the tax documents</h2>
        <p>With the tax data imported and the profile documents completed, you're ready to begin completing the engagement's federal and provincial tax forms. Because you completed the Tax Optimiser, only the forms that are relevant to your tax engagement are shown in the Documents tab.</p>
        <p>To see the complete list of available tax forms, select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Tax-edit-icon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) on the <b>Documents</b> page, or open the <b>Tax Forms List</b> document. Use your browser's search function (<b>Ctrl-F</b>) to help locate specific documents.</p>
        <p>Your selections also determine which worksheets, if any, are listed. Worksheets are documents designed to streamline your engagement work.</p>
        <h3>Practice set - Navigate between related tax documents</h3>
        <p>You can easily navigate between workcharts and their linked schedule documents. There are two options for moving between these documents.</p>
        <p>When you select a field that has a single source, you will see this dialog:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Jump-to-source-613x191.png" alt="The &quot;How would you like to override this field?&quot; dialogue with the Jump To Source option" />
        </p>
        <p>When you select Jump To Source,  the source document opens and jumps to the appropriate line, with the exact source field highlighted in flashing blue.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tax-highlighted-field-744x404.png" alt="Source field highlighted in blue" />
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>In this example, your client has purchased a new fixed asset, a building.</p>
        <p>Use <b>Worksheet - S8 CCA</b> to manage fixed assets.</p>
        <p>Select the appropriate class for the firm's new fixed asset. Select the <b>Add</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Tax-add-icon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) in the CCA Class field.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tax-add-asset-class.png" alt="Add icon in the CCA Class field" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the appropriate CCA class, then select <b>OK</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tax-select-asset-class.png" alt="CCA Classes" />
        </p>
        <p>Scroll to the bottom of the worksheet, then select <b>Add</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-SE-add.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />). On the new line, select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Tax-edit-icon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />). A dialog opens, where you can enter the new asset's information.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tax-enter-new-asset-info.png" alt="Dialog where you can enter the new asset's information" />
        </p>
        <p>Once tax documents are filled out, you can use the <b>Enclosure letter</b> under the <b>TAX - GENERAL AND FEDERAL | Client communication</b> folder as guidance for communicating key findings with your client.</p>
        <h2>Search tax forms and worksheets</h2>
        <p>When working on a tax form or worksheet, you can search, edit visibility and open all of the tax forms and worksheets in the engagement.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/search-button.png" alt="Tax form and worksheet search button" />
        </p>
