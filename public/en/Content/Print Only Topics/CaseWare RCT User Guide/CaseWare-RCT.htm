        <h2>What are Professional accounting services?</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Professional accounting services</b> are the ad hoc engagements your firm provides that fall outside the scope of a compilation engagement. Under the <i>Canadian Standard for Related Services (CSRS) 4200, Compilation Engagements</i>, practitioners are no longer required to perform a compilation when engaged in ad hoc services such as bookkeeping, tax or non-attest services such as preparing financial information based on information provided by management.</p>
        <p>The <b>Professional accounting services</b> engagement type unlocks all the features and functionality designed to enhance productivity by using integrated automation and secure workflow processes.</p>
        <p>Through the use of Caseware ReviewComp, your firm can optimize efficiency by performing multiple engagement types all from one platform.</p>
