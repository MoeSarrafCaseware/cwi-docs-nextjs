        <h1>File tax returns</h1>
        <p>Caseware ReviewComp lets you file the completed return with the CRA. To do this, you must have the appropriate credentials already set up. Alternatively, you can export the return as a PDF file and then either share it electronically or print a hard copy.</p>
        <h2><a name="File"></a>File the tax return using EFILE</h2>
        <p>With the tax data imported, the engagement work complete, and all outstanding issues fixed, you can begin your electronic filing via the CRA's EFILE program. Select <b>EFILE</b> from the top menu to open the EFILE information page.</p>
        <p>From this page, you can file your return to the CRA via one of two sets of credentials. If your firm is a Certified Tax Preparer, you can enter your <b>CRA Login Information</b>. Alternatively, you can enter a <b>WACode (Web Access Code)</b> provided by the client.</p>
        <p>If you require a Web Access Code and have not yet been provided with one, select <b>WAC - Web Access Code Online Request</b> and complete the request form.</p>
        <h2>Print the return</h2>
        <p>If your client requests a copy of the return for their records, you can create a PDF file directly from Caseware ReviewComp. This can be saved to disk and shared with your client electronically or printed as a hard copy. </p>
        <p>Select <b>Print</b> from any open tax document to select the document or return you want to print.</p>
