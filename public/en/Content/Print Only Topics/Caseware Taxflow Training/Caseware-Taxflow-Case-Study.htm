        <h1>Section 2: Client correspondence (Queries)</h1>
        <p>When performing tax work, you may need to collaborate with a contact to retrieve additional information. The interaction between a staff member and a contact via queries can be summarized in the following figure.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/13-client-correspondence.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To request information such as the trial balance, financial statements, taxation assessments or general entity inquiries, complete the <b>1-100Q Financial data and general entity information queries and responses</b> query. You can also create and send a new query by selecting <b>Create a document</b> | <b>Query</b>.</p>
        <p>After your contact provides the missing information, you'll receive an email notification with their response. You can review their response and either accept or reopen the query.</p>

        <h1>Section 3: Import the client's data</h1>
        <p>Caseware Taxflow allows you to import trial balance and transaction data from a variety of sources.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                <p><b>Tip:</b> Caseware Taxflow uses the same standard taxonomy structure as OnPoint apps. When you import the trial balance from an OnPoint Audit, OnPoint PCR or OnPoint DAS  engagement, the accounts will be automatically assigned to the same financial groupings as the original source. If the groupings are not mapped, follow up with the audit &amp; assurance team to ensure they have mapped the accounts correctly in their engagement.</p>

        <p>After importing the client's data and completing the assignment to financial groups, you can review or modify the tax groups using the <b>1-550 Tax groups assignment</b> form. The form includes a list of financial group accounts, account details, final balances for the current and prior years and the default tax group.</p>
