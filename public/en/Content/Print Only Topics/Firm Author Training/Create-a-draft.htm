        <p>As a template author, it is important for you to know the exact version of your OnPoint product, since this could affect the type of content your users have in their product. If as a firm, you are facing issues, there is a possibility that the issue has been fixed in the latest release. In fact, when you contact our support team, the first thing they suggest might be to update your release via the update button as we previously discussed. By using the latest release version, you also reduce your work as a firm template author since the new content may have also resolved any content deficiencies which may have existed in the product.</p>
        <p>In the draft template, select <b>Information</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-firm-authoring-info.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) , then <b>About</b> to view information about your version of OnPoint PCR.				</p>
