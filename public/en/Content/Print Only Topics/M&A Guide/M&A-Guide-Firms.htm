        <p>If your firm meets one of the aforementioned scenarios, consider the following before you request the merge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Which Cloud site is the “Primary” and which are “Secondary”?</b>
                </p>
                <p>To determine the flow of merged settings between the Cloud sites, one must be designated the “Primary” and the others “Secondary”. This designation is only relevant during the merge and will not exist afterward.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Who is the “Primary Administrator”?</b>
                </p>
                <p>You will need to select an administrator of the “Primary” Cloud site to receive administrator permissions across all business units and the ability to create new business units.</p>
