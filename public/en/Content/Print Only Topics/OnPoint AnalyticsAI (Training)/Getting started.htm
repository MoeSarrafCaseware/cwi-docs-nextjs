        <h1>Getting started</h1>
        <p>You'll need to do some basic set-up tasks before you move on to a client engagement. </p>
        <h2>Create a new entity</h2>
        <p>An entity is a workspace that you can use to organize and collaborate on your engagement files from a single location for a client. When your firm first starts to use Cloud, you need to create a new entity for each client.</p>
        <p class="note">
            <b>Note:</b> The instructions below explain the process for adding an individual client entity. You can also import a list of your clients in order to create all of your client entities at once. For more information, refer to Caseware's online help.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Entities</b>. This takes you to the Entities page.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New</b>, and then select <b>Clients</b>. The Create Entity dialog displays.</p>

        <p>Once you have finished entering all of the relevant information for your client, select <b>Save</b>. The client entity is created, and you can see it added to the list on the Entities page.</p>
        <h2>Create accounts for your staff members</h2>
        <p>Once you create entities for each of your clients, grant Cloud access to other staff members in your firm. You can create a new account for each staff member who needs to collaborate on your engagements.</p>
        <p class="note">
            <b>Note:</b> The instructions below describe how to add individual staff members. You can also import a list of your staff members to create all of their user profiles at once. For more information, refer to Caseware's online help.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Staff</b>. This takes you to the Staff page.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New</b>, and then <b>ADD | Staff</b>. The Add Staff dialog displays. Similar to creating an entity, there are different property groups where you enter information for new staff members.</p>
        <p>
            <b>General</b>
        </p>
        <p>Enter an email address and a first and last name for the new staff member. The email address will be the username for their account, and they will log into Cloud with it.</p>
        <p>The other fields are optional.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Password</b>
        </p>
        <p>There are three initial password setting options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Set by User</b> - the staff member will set their own password when they first log in. Cloud sends an email with instructions on how to log in to the portal.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Auto Generated</b> - a random password is chosen by Cloud. Cloud does not send an email to the staff member, so you will need to provide them with the login page URL, their user ID, and their password.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Set</b> - you choose a password for the staff member. Again, Cloud does not send an email, so you will need to provide them with their login information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this training, we will use the default option: <b>Set by User</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Groups</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can assign the staff member's account to one or more staff groups. If you create groups in Cloud, you can specify permissions and access levels for members of that group. If you add any additional accounts as group members, they automatically inherit the group permissions and access levels.</p>
        <p>The <b>All Staff</b> group is available out of the box in Caseware Cloud. All staff members are automatically added to this group by default. In this training, we will use the <b>All Staff</b> group.</p>
        <p>
            <b>System-Wide Roles</b>
        </p>
        <p>When you grant one or more system-wide roles to a staff member, they get a set of access rights that apply to all of the content in your Cloud firm. For example, if you grant the system-wide <b>Viewer</b> role to a staff member, they can see all of the entities in your firm and can view all files and engagements in those entities. System-wide roles are the easiest way to set the access rights for staff members in your firm.</p>
        <p>Grant this staff member the system-wide <b>Editor</b> role. This role allows them to view all the firm content and make changes while working on that content.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Apps</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can grant your staff member access to Cloud apps. With this access, they can view engagements for an app and create new engagements or files for it.</p>
        <p>Note that by default, the <b>All Staff</b> group grants its members the ability to view and create engagements for all the available Cloud apps. If you need to restrict access to some apps, remove some of the permissions on the global group. This enables you to select which staff member should work with which apps.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Standard Hours</b>
        </p>
        <p>This setting is if your firm uses the Caseware Cloud Time app to handle time and expense entries. Leave this section set to Organization standard hours.</p>
        <p>Once you have entered all of the information for your staff member's new account, select <b>Save</b>. They will receive a welcome email from Cloud notifying them that their account has been created and instructing them on how to log in.</p>
        <h2>Create an account for your client</h2>
        <p>One of the major benefits of OnPoint AnalyticsAI is that you can collaborate directly with your clients on engagements. You need to set up a contact account so your clients can access their engagement file.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Contacts</b>. This takes you to the Contacts page.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New</b>, then <b>ADD | Contacts</b>. The Add Contact dialog displays.</p>
        <p>
            <b>General</b>
        </p>
        <p>Enter a first and last name and an email address for your client contact. In the Entity field, select the client entity that you created earlier. Once you have selected the client entity, select the <b>Contact - Entity Collaborator</b> role to set the access level for this account. This role allows your client to create discussions, tasks, and file requests on Cloud. It also allows them to collaborate on engagements for OnPoint AnalyticsAI.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Password</b>
        </p>
        <p>The same password options for staff accounts apply here. Because the email address is yours, choose <b>Set</b> and uncheck <b>User must change password on next sign in</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Groups</b>
        </p>
        <p>Contact groups work the same way as staff groups. The contact group available out of the box is <b>All Contacts</b> and by default, your client is automatically a member of that group.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Apps</b>
        </p>
        <p>Just like the <b>All Staff</b> group, the <b>All Contacts</b> group grants its members the ability to view and create engagements for all the available Cloud apps. Check the permissions and make sure that your contact can view OnPoint AnalyticsAI engagements.</p>
        <p>Once you finish setting up your client contact's new account, select <b>Save</b>. They will receive a welcome email from Cloud notifying them that their account has been created and instructing them on how to log in.</p>
