        <h1>Carry forward an engagement</h1>
        <p>Carry forward is a time-saving utility. You can carry forward an engagement to re-use information, as you can accept all of last year's changes or only work on the individual items that have changed.</p>
        <p>When it comes to interim reporting, each interim period must have a separate file. However, the engagement file is based on the previous period.</p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/SE-what-is-not-carried-forward.flsnp" />
        <p>For annual engagements, the prior year adjusted trial balances carry forward to the <b>Prior Year</b> column in documents and financial statements.</p>
        <p> You  have the option to accept or reject changes for the previous period in the new file. You can also view procedures that have been added or modified by the firm author between versions. For example, if you begin working on a quarter one file and there is a content change by the firm author, when you create your quarter two file, you can view the new changes made by firm authors.</p>
        <p>Now let's carry the file forward into the next period.</p>
