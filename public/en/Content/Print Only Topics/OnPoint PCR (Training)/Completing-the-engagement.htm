        <p>With all of your fieldwork complete, you are ready to start preparing your conclusions. </p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Financial statements</h2>
        <p>At the conclusion of the engagement, you will create a financial statements document for the client where you explain your findings and present a conclusion. OnPoint PCR has a built-in template that will make it easier for you to prepare the financial statements.</p>
        <p>On the Documents page, under the Financial Statements and Wrap-up section, open document <b>3-150 Financial Statements and Report</b>.</p>
        <p>Near the top of the report is a detailed guidance section. On that page, there is a table that outlines each section of the financial statements and indicates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>when it is included in the report</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>what elements are required in the section</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>what the AR-C references for the section are</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the guidance section, below the link, you will find additional information about completing some of the required sections of the financial statements.</p>
        <p>Each financial statements document includes the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Title page</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Table of Contents</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Report section</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Financial statement tables</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Statement of Income</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Statement of Comprehensive Income</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Statement of Retained Earnings</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Statement of Cash Flows</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Notes to the Financial Statements</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may wish to review the linked document before proceeding. </p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Customize the financial statements</h2>
        <p>Much of the content in the financial statements document is already populated for you. The content in the review report is based on your answers to the questions in the <b>Client Acceptance and Continuance</b> document. Groups and accounts on the financial statements tables are from the trial balance.</p>
        <p>However, you will need to make other changes to customize the financial statements for your client.</p>
        <h3>Replace the placeholder text</h3>
        <p>As you saw in the engagement letter, the review report paragraphs include placeholder text that you are meant to replace. Placeholder text locations may be displayed in red font and enclosed in brackets. They could also be displayed with pull-down menus where you can select the correct name, date, or information for this engagement.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-financial-statements-placeholder-text-example-1134x500.png" alt="Financial statement - place holder text" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the <b>Edit </b>icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />), and then select the text area you wish to edit. Replace any placeholder text with real content appropriate for your client and the engagement. Also select values for any placeholder pull-down menus. Once you have made all changes that you need to, select the <b>Edit </b>icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) again to save your changes.</p>
        <h3>Edit a financial statement table</h3>
        <p>While you cannot change the specific accounts and groups that are included in a financial statement table, you can make some changes to the content that is displayed.</p>
        <h4>Enter information into a financial statement table</h4>
        <p>Many of the tables in the financial statements are populated automatically. The information in them is pulled straight from the trial balance, to make financial statement preparation easier for you. However, you will also likely need to enter some additional information yourself.</p>
        <p>Some of the lines in the financial statements are <b>input rows</b>. In an input row, you can enter amounts into the fields, and these amounts will be included in final calculations for the table.</p>
        <p>For example, scroll to the Statement of Cash Flows, then select the <b>Edit </b>icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) at the top of the page. </p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: For the Statement of Cash Flows to be visible, you must have selected <b>Indirect method</b> in response to <b>Which method, if any, is being used for the Statement of Cash Flows?</b> in document <b>1-110 Engagement Acceptance and Continuance</b>.</p>
        <p>Normally, rows with no values are hidden from the standard view of a table, but in edit mode you can see all of the input rows. Once you enter any financial data into an input row, that row will be displayed in the statement of cash flows.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-financial-statements-cash-flow-edit.png" alt="Financial statement dynamic table - input rows" />
        </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If you want to enter a different amount in a row that already has automatic values, select the <b>Settings </b>icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-dynamic-table-row-settings.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) at the end of the row and then select <b>Override calculated balances</b>.</p>
        <h4>Expand a line in the financial statements</h4>
        <p>Many of the financial statement tables collapse accounts into their groupings by default. You can expand lines in the financial statement to give more details about some areas of the engagement file.</p>
        <p>For example, go to the Balance Sheet in the financial statements.</p>
        <p>Assets, Noncurrent displays totals for two areas: <i>Property, Plant and Equipment, net</i> and <i>Long-term Investments, net</i>. Now, you decide  to give the client more information about the <i>Property, Plant and Equipment, net</i> group.</p>
        <p>Select the <b>Expand/hide</b> lines icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-expand-hide-lines.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) beside the group name. </p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-financial-statements-balance-statement-expand-lines.png" alt="Dynamic table - expand lines" />
        </p>
        <p>All of the lines under your selected group are now displayed, and you can see the amounts for each different category under <i>Property, Plant and Equipment</i>, along with the amount for <i>Accumulated Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization</i>.</p>
        <p>All of the lines under your selected group are now displayed, and you can see the amounts for <i>Automobiles - cost, Property, Plant and Equipment </i>and<i> Accumulated Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization</i>. Select the <b>Expand/hide</b> lines icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-expand-hide-lines.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) beside the Property, Plant and Equipment subgroup to display all of the detail lines that make up the group.</p>
        <p>To collapse a subgroup, select <b>Expand/hide</b> lines icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-expand-hide-lines.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) again.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If you want to see more details about a balance on the financial statement without changing a table, you can select the line with that balance to drill down and display more details.</p>
        <h4>Modify the description of a financial statement line</h4>
        <p>You can change the descriptions for lines in the financial statements. Some of the lines in the financial statements are <b>input lines</b>. You can select an input line and enter a new description. You can tell input lines from other lines by the different background color.</p>
        <p>To change the descriptions of any lines that are not input rows, you will need to change the  document settings. Select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) , then select the <b>Settings </b>icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-dynamic-table-row-settings.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) and enable <b>Allow override of line names</b>.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Add a note to the financial statements</h2>
        <p>The Notes to the Financial Statements section is at the bottom of the financial statements document. If you need to provide any supplementary information about the results of your engagement, you can add that information here.</p>
        <p>Each note can include a guidance section with information on any changes that you might need to make to it as the preparer. They also typically have one or more text areas that contain explanations relevant for the note.</p>
        <p>Some of the notes in your engagement may also include a dynamic table. Dynamic tables contain specific lines from the trial balance or custom rows where you can input your own data. These tables are intended to highlight specific parts of the trial balance or to support your conclusions.</p>
        <p>Normally, the firm author at your firm will add notes for the financial statements to the document template. When the author publishes that template, all new OnPoint engagement files will include the same notes in the financial statements document.</p>
        <p>In this demo file, there are no notes added to the template yet, so we will create a sample note. This note will be titled "PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT", and it will display a dynamic table with the current and prior year balances for <b>Machinery and Equipment</b>, <b>Furniture and Fixtures</b> and <b>Leasehold Improvements</b>.</p>
        <p><b>To add a note to the financial statements</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Scroll down to the Notes to the Financial Statements section, then select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Scroll to the bottom of the document, then select (<b>BLANK</b>).</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/cloud-onpoint-new-note-section.png" alt="Add a note to the financial statements" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter <b>PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT</b> as the new title for your note. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>New notes are empty by default, so you will need to add sections to the note to display your information. Next, you will add a text area to your note to introduce the dynamic table:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Under the note, select <b>+ New section</b>, then choose <b>+ Text Area</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the gray text area, then enter the following:</p>
                <p><i>Property and equipment at June 30, 2017 consisted of:</i>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have added a description for the contents of the new note.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-financial-statements-add-note-text-area-added.png" alt="Add note description " />
        </p>
        <p>To add the balance information for the property and equipment account groups, you will need to add a dynamic table. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Under the text area, select <b>+ New section</b>, then choose <b>+ Dynamic Table</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the new Dynamic Table section, select the <b>Settings </b>icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-dynamic-table-row-settings.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) in the section heading, and choose <b>Edit Layout</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the left side of the table, select the <b>Add </b>icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-add-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt="Add icon" />) to add a new row, then select <b>Trial Balance Data</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter the word <i>property</i> to filter the list. Select the <b>Property, Plant and Equipment</b> group (with the 45,000 balance) to add it to the row.</p>
                <p class="image">

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>At the end of the line, select the <b>Expand lines </b>icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-expand-lines-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt="Expand lines icon" />).</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>At the top of the page, select <b>Save &amp; Close</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have added a dynamic table to your note. When you scroll to the bottom of the financial statements document, you will see the note with all its new content.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-financial-statements-note-dynamic-table-updated.png" alt="A dynamic table in a note" />
        </p>
        <h3>Add a cross reference to a line</h3>
        <p>If a line in the financial statement table requires more explanation, you can add a cross reference to the line that links to one of the notes to the financial statements.</p>
        <p>For example, you decide that you want to provide a breakdown of the <i>Property, Plant and Equipment</i> group, but you do not want to display it on the balance sheet. You can link a line in the balance sheet to the PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT note that you created earlier.</p>
        <p>To show the <b>Notes</b> column:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />), then scroll to the Balance Sheet section of the financial statements and select the <b>Settings </b>icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-dynamic-table-row-settings.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) beside <b>Dynamic Table - Balance Sheet</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Edit Layout</b> and the <b>Add</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-add-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />)above the empty column.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Note reference</b> from the <b>Type</b> drop-down, then select <b>SAVE &amp; CLOSE</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>At the top of the balance sheet, select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
        <p>A <b>Note</b> column now appears in the <b>Balance Sheet</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-financial-statements-note-dynamic-table.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="image">Select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) again. You will see that each group name now has a <b>#</b> link in the Note column.</p>
        <p class="image">

        <p>Select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-edit-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) again to save your changes. The <i>Property, Plant and Equipment</i> group now includes a reference to the note in the Note column.</p>

        <h2>Print the financial statements</h2>
        <p>Once you have finished preparing the client's financial statements and your reviewer has signed off on the document, you will want to print a copy of the financial statements to present to the client. You might also print other copies of the document while you are still in the process of working on it in order to review the impact your changes will have on the finished product.</p>
        <p>You cannot print directly from OnPoint PCR. Instead, printing creates a PDF copy of the file for your review. </p>
        <p>Select <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) | <b>Print Settings</b> to display the Print Settings dialog.
