        <p>The practice aids are designed for small and medium-­sized (SME) non-­public companies, and do not address the wide range of circumstances or specific industry issues that may exist for a particular client or groups of clients (such as those operating in a specialized industry, government or non-­profit organization and complex IT environments). Consequently, the forms should always be tailored to address the known facts and circumstances of each engagement.</p>
