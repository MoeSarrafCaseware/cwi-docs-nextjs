        <h1>Perform a tax export</h1>
        <p>The AICPA have enabled a more comprehensive workflow to ensure that users are able to seamlessly transition their data from Caseware Cloud OnPoint to their choice of tax software. </p>
        <h3>Practice set

</h3>
        <p>To create a tax export file,  open the  <b>4-100 Tax Export</b> document.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/4100-tax-export.PNG" alt="4-100 Tax Export" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the <b>View</b> drop-down list to choose the display option for the document:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Show IDs</b> - View the line items from the tax software where the information from Caseware will be transferred to.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Dynamic Form Width</b> - Have the form automatically adjusts  width based on the browser page width.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The left panel in the form displays the <b>Entity Type</b>, <b>Tax Vendor</b>, and <b>Tax Year</b>. Note that more options will be available in future releases.</p>
        <p>The right side panel displays multiple tax forms. It is recommended that you select the applicable Tax Form and open it before starting the export so that you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>confirm the numbers were correctly transferred from the product into the forms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>reduce the export time (since the information has been populated and is already available in the forms).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, let's launch the <b>1120 U.S. Income Tax Return.</b></p>
        <p>You can assign one or more accounts to a single tax code. Select the <b>plus sign</b> and choose an account to assign to a single tax code. To assign more than one account to a tax code, add a  place a comma then select another account.</p>
        <p>You'll find that the application adds the account balances for each tax code. The corresponding cell in the totals column is updated with the total amount.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once you are satisfied with the data presented in the applicable forms, go back to document 4-100 to start the export.</p>
        <p>Select <b>Export</b>, then specify where the exported file will be saved. In some browsers, the file is automatically saved in the Downloads folder.</p>
        <p>If you need help to import the tax file into your tax software, please contact the respective tax vendor support center.</p>
