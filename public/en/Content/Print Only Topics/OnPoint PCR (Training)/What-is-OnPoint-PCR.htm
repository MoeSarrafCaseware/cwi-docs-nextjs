        <h1>What is OnPoint PCR?</h1>
        <p>Caseware Cloud OnPoint is a comprehensive, cloud-based audit engagement solution for small and mid-sized firms, featuring guided client onboarding and continuous optimization using the latest methodology from the AICPA, and offering real-time collaboration with your colleagues and clients. It combines Caseware's cloud platform, AICPA guidance and distribution from CPA.com.</p>
        <p>Caseware Cloud OnPoint PCR guides you through preparations, compilations and reviews. As you set up a client file, the first question you're  asked is the type of the engagement (profile).  The software  automatically populates the client file with the checklists needed to complete the engagement based upon the answers to engagement set up questions. The accountant always has the ability to further modify the checklists adding additional steps if needed. Each of the engagement profiles (described below) includes procedures to meet the requirements of AR­C 60 General Principles for Engagements Performed in Accordance with SSARS.</p>
