        <h1>Housekeeping</h1>
        <p>To use OnPoint Audit, you must have a Caseware Cloud account with access to the OnPoint Audit app.</p>
        <h1>What is OnPoint Audit?</h1>
        <p>OnPoint Audit is a purely cloud-based solution built for performing audits in the US market and is used by small and mid-sized US firms. It features a guided workflow that reduces redundancies and increases both productivity and the quality of audit engagements.</p>
        <p>The auditor's responses to various checklists intelligently populate the client file with the relevant documents and content. Engagement team members and other stakeholders can modify the checklists and add additional steps if needed. For each engagement type, the predefined checklist procedures meet the requirements of the relevant regulatory standards.</p>
        <p>As you work through your engagement, you can assign tasks and document requests to client contacts and staff members, all without leaving the OnPoint Audit interface. The content and workflow in OnPoint Audit provide non-authoritative guidance on applying auditing standards issued by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA).</p>
        <h1>Add an entity</h1>
        <p>In Caseware Cloud, an entity represents the client organization or an internal department. Most entities belong to one of two types, depending on their function: client or internal. Client entities represent a client's legal entities or components. Internal entities represent departments, activities, or specializations within your business.</p>
        <p>To create a new entity, click on the plus sign in the upper right-hand corner.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/01.png" />
        </p>
        <p>A <b>Create Entity</b> dialog will appear, prompting you to enter the necessary information to create a new entity (client). Only certain users have access to this dialog.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/02.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Depending on how security permissions are configured within the Caseware Cloud site, after creating the entity, we may need to share it with the relevant staff members so they can create engagements for the entity. To do this, click the share icon, select the staff member, and assign them the appropriate role. This will grant the staff member full access to the entity. Then, click <b>Share</b> to complete the process.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/03.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/04.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If you do not have permission to create new entities in your Caseware Cloud site, you will need to ask your administrator to create the entity for you and ensure that you are granted access to it.</p>
        <h1>Add staff</h1>
        <p>Staff include managers, partners, and junior or senior staff accountants or auditors who use Caseware Cloud Apps to perform audits, reviews, compilations, or other types of engagements related to assurance, financial reporting, tax, and compliance. Staff members typically take on the roles of preparer, reviewer, and second reviewer in Cloud engagements.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/05.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/06.png" />
        </p>
        <h1>Add contacts</h1>
        <p>Contacts are points of contact on the client side who are responsible for collaborating with engagement team members. In Caseware Cloud Apps, contacts typically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Respond to the engagement team's questions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Provide requested documents and information to the engagement team</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Perform other collaboration tasks, such as commenting on activities or questions from staff</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/07.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The information needed to create a new contact includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Email address</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>First name</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Last name</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Entity - select the entity the user will be associated with</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Entity role - select <b>Entity Collaborator</b> so they can respond to requests or questions from staff</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Create an engagement</h1>
        <p>An engagement is a specific project or task that an accounting firm undertakes for a client. This could be an audit, a review, a tax filing, or any other service the firm provides. In Caseware Cloud, an engagement can be thought of as a workspace for that project. Within an entity, all related engagements are stored, including prior-year completed engagements.</p>
        <p>When a new engagement is created, the start and end dates are defined, and any relevant budget information is entered. The engagement is where all the work for that project takes place. It's where you can manage documents, complete checklists, set deadlines and budgets, and more.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/08.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the down arrow to choose the entity you will be working on.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/09.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There is a search box at the top that allows you to filter through the available entities. Click on the name of the entity, and a screen similar to this will appear. This screen contains all the information that was entered when the entity was set up.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/10.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Scroll down to the Engagements section and select <b>New</b>. Choose <b>OnPointAudit</b> to start a new audit engagement.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Entity - the entity that the engagement is associated with</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Name - name of the review engagement</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Carry forward data from - select an engagement to carry forward prior year's data, if applicable</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Entity for source engagement - allows you to copy an existing engagement from another entity</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Start and end date of the engagement</p>
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preparer - select the staff who will be preparers for this audit</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reviewer - select the staff who will be reviewers for this audit</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Description</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/11.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select <b>Save</b> to store the information and open the engagement in OnPoint Audit.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/12.png" />
        </p>
        <h1>Workflow navigation</h1>
        <p>The <b>Workflow</b> navigation pane allows us to change the operating name, year-end date, and currency. It also displays a color-coded legend that indicates the current stage of the review process. At the moment, it shows light green to indicate that the engagement has just been created and no work has started yet. The workflow also includes a <b>Lockdown</b> button, which will be covered later in this document.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/13.png" />
        </p>
        <h1>Create a document</h1>
        <p>OnPoint Audit allows you to add your own documents within the engagement. This can be useful for including notes relevant to the engagement. To add a document, click the plus sign in the upper right-hand corner.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/14.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You will see a list of different document types that you can add.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/15.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Documents can be added either at the overall document level or within specific sections. For example, selecting the plus sign in the upper corner of the <b>Overview and scope</b> section will add the document to that section.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/16.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Let's add an overview document to the template. This document can be used to include your own overview comments for the audit.</p>
        <p>First, select the <b>Create a document</b> icon. This will display the document properties.</p>
        <p>The Document Properties include the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Identifier is the reference number that determines the document's position. In this scenario, if the identifier is smaller than 1-050, the document will appear before; if it is larger, it will appear after. If the identifier has already been used, an error will be shown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Name is the name of the document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signoff scheme determines whether the document needs to be signed off.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Schemes define the type of signoff required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edit visibility allows the user to control when the document is visible, such as only displaying it if a certain selection has been made.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use this information to create an Overview document.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/17.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/18.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Open the Overview document by selecting it. On the left-hand side, you will see the Document Map, where you can add different sections to your document. By selecting the plus sign next to Areas, you are given three options: New Area, Table of Contents, and Embedded PDF. Select <b>New Area</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/19.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/20.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Name the area "Overview." By selecting the plus sign under <b>Add content using the dropdown below</b>, you will see several options.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/21.png" />
        </p>
        <p> In this scenario, you can add a text section, which allows you to enter an overview for the audit.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/22.png" />
        </p>
        <h1>Checklists</h1>
        <p>OnPoint Audit is made up of a series of checklists that, by default, are only visible based on the information submitted in other templates. In other words, as you respond to questions in a checklist, those responses may trigger the visibility of other checklists related to that area of the audit. For example, most checklists remain hidden until the audit has been accepted in the 1-100 Engagement - Acceptance/Continuance checklist.</p>
        <p>To view hidden checklists (those that have not yet become visible based on your selections), you can select the three dots in the Documents section and then choose <b>Hidden items</b>. This will display all available documents.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/23.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Documents that are hidden by default have a crossed-out eye icon next to them.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/24.png" />
        </p>
        <p>It can be helpful to understand why a document is hidden. By selecting the icon, you can view the visibility settings, which explain why the document is or is not visible.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/25.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In this example, the visibility of the document is determined by the 1-100 Engagement - Acceptance/Continuance template. At the bottom, it lists the section of the template it relates to, along with the expected response and the current response. Since the expected and current responses differ, the document is not visible by default. Once the response changes to match the expected value, the checklist will become visible. In some cases, a checklist must meet multiple criteria to become visible.</p>
        <p>To hide the checklists again, select the three dots in the Documents section and disable <b>Hidden items</b>. It is generally best to keep them hidden so the focus remains on the documents that are currently needed, rather than displaying all documents.</p>
        <p>Checklists will generally have two or more tabs, including a <b>Procedures</b> tab, which contains the questions that need to be answered or documented, and a <b>Guidance</b> tab, which provides additional information about the checklist along with references to supporting documents. Depending on the type of checklist, other tabs might also be present.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/26.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Generally, there are different types of questions within a checklist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Manual - where the auditor documents responses directly</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="Images/27.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Picklist - where the auditor selects one item from a list (e.g., Yes, No, N/A)</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="Images/28.png" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="Images/29.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Multi-Picklist - where the auditor selects multiple items from a list</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="Images/30.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Within a checklist, the left side contains a <b>Document Map</b>, which allows you to jump to different sections by selecting the corresponding link. The Document Map can be hidden by selecting the arrow icon at the bottom of the map.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/31.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Next to many of the questions, there is a light bulb icon. This indicates that additional information is available for that question. Clicking the light bulb opens guidance on the left-hand side, which may include further explanations or links to source material.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/32.png" />
        </p>
        <p>While we've seen how document checklists can be hidden in the Documents tab, individual questions can also be hidden within a checklist. To view hidden questions, select the three dots in the upper right-hand corner and choose <b>Hidden items</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/33.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Hidden questions will appear with a specific icon.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/34.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To understand why a question is hidden, select the eyeball icon to view its visibility settings. These work the same way as the visibility settings for document checklists.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/35.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the upper right-hand corner, there are several icons:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/36.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The flag icon is for issues. Issues can be created at the question, document, or overall entity level.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The printer icon allows you to print the document checklist.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The tools icon provides access to review tools.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The pencil icon allows you to add additional procedures to the checklist if needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The final icon allows you to collapse or expand the different sections within the document.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Engagement acceptance and setup</h1>
        <h2>1-100 Engagement Acceptance/Continuance</h2>
        <p>In order to start the audit, the 1-100 Engagement - Acceptance/Continuance document must be completed. The objective of this document is "To assess whether the level of engagement risk is acceptable to the firm; the firm has the necessary competencies; the firm and staff comply with the independence requirements; and the engagement preconditions have been met."</p>
        <p>Once you understand how the document works, it is time to begin filling in the first document, namely 1-100 Engagement - Acceptance/Continuance. This document is broken down into several sections, with others added as questions are answered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Description of engagement</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Engagement risk assessment</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Engagement risk factors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Engagement preconditions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Management integrity</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following is a sample of responses for the first section (note that these may not reflect your specific audit and should be adjusted accordingly).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/37.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Entity type</b> is pre-populated based on the information entered when the entity was created. The <b>Financial reporting framework</b> refers to the specific framework used by the entity; you must select the most appropriate one.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/38.png" />
        </p>
        <p><b>Continuance/New audit</b> is important, as it drives many of the checklists. The question asks, "Is this a continuance of an audit engagement?" If the answer is no, the checklists for a new engagement will be used. If the answer is yes, the checklists for a continuing audit are used.</p>
        <p>Many of the responses also determine how the financial statements will be displayed. For example, if you select yes under <b>Consolidation</b> to indicate that this audit engagement is for a consolidated or combined entity, then the financial statements will reflect that they are consolidated.</p>
        <p>The next section relates to the engagement risk assessment and asks, "Would accepting/continuing with this engagement violate any of the firm's quality assurance policies on client acceptance/continuance or any ethical requirements (including independence)?" The following section asks whether any risks exist that would impact engagement acceptance or continuance.</p>
        <p>As the questions are answered, the auditor's initials will appear next to each question to indicate who responded.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/39.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Hovering your cursor over the initials will display additional information, such as the full name of the user and the date of the sign-off.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/40.png" />
        </p>
        <p>At the bottom of the form, there are <b>Conclusion</b> and <b>Partner Acknowledgement</b> sections. The conclusion addresses the overall risk assessment and whether an engagement quality control review is required.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/41.png" />
        </p>
        <p> The Partner Acknowledgement either accepts the engagement, at which point all necessary checklists to begin the audit become accessible, or indicates that the engagement is not accepted.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/42.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once the page is complete, you can use review tools to highlight areas such as engagement changes, responses, or incomplete items (such as missing sign-offs). You can access the <b>Review tools</b> from the list of tools in the upper right-hand corner.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/43.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When selected, you will see the following information:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/44.png" />
        </p>

        </table>
        <p>From the above, we can see that there are three items that have not been signed off, indicated by a red <b>x</b> next to them.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/45.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To correct this, go through the questions and click the checkmark to indicate that they have been reviewed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/46.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There is another way to check if all items have been reviewed. At the top of the page, there is an indicator showing the total number of items and how many have been reviewed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/47.png" />
        </p>
        <p>For example, 6/7 means there are 7 items in the section, and 6 have been reviewed. Once the missing review is completed, this indicator will be replaced by a green checkmark (<img src="Images/48.png" />).</p>
        <p>There are a few ways to sign off on the entire document. One option is within the document itself, in the upper right corner, there is a place to perform the signoff.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/49.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Depending on the importance of the document, the required signoffs may vary. In some cases, it may only require <b>Prepared by</b> and <b>Reviewed by</b> signoffs. Since this document authorizes the acceptance of the audit, it also requires the partner's review. Each role should click <b>Sign off</b> to add their signoff to the document.</p>
        <p>Once the document is complete and signed off, you can return to the <b>Documents</b> tab to view other documents. In the <b>Documents</b> tab, you can also approve and view approvals for the document. Approval can be completed from this tab as well.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/50.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Now that the engagement has been accepted, the <b>Documents</b> tab has been populated. In the table of contents on the right-hand side, you can see all areas of the engagement. The circles will gradually turn green as the related documents are completed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/51.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>1-200 Engagement setup</h2>
        <p>This document gathers information that helps populate other documents, such as the letter of representation and the financial statements. For example, by asking whether your firm is a sole proprietorship, the answer will update many documents with appropriate language changes, such as "I" or "We."</p>
        <p>Two questions in particular are important and influence the templates used. The first asks which industry the entity operates in. A list of industries is provided, and if the entity operates in any of them, additional templates will be added to address those specific industries.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/52.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The second important question concerns business cycles. Your selections here determine which checklists are needed to perform work related to the selected business cycles. In this case, you should select all business cycles that apply to the entity.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/53.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>PBC requests and secure client portal</h2>
        <p>OnPoint Audit includes a collaboration portal within Caseware Cloud. This portal allows you to securely send requests for information or document sign-off to the client, and enables the client to respond directly to those requests. The responses are added directly to the OnPoint Audit templates. This functionality helps firms serve their clients with speed and efficiency, enabling immediate responses to questions and the exchange of data and documents.</p>
        <p>The first template that uses this feature is 1-250 Terms of Engagement. In the <b>Documents</b> tab, there are three links related to 1-250, each serving a different purpose:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/54.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The first link, marked with an envelope icon, represents the draft engagement letter. This is where you prepare or modify the engagement letter template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The second link, marked with a person icon, is the query link. This is where you send the draft prepared in the previous template to the client and receive their response.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The third link is where the signed engagement letter is stored once it has been returned by the client.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>1-250 Terms of engagement - Engagement letter - Draft</h3>
        <p>Open 1-250 Terms of engagement - Engagement letter - draft. This will open the document that you can review and change as needed. The sections in yellow are instructions and will not be part of the final document. The client will not see these parts when the document is sent to them. The yellow sections provide additional guidance on how to prepare the document. These sections can be hidden by selecting the light bulb icon.</p>
        <p>In the Document Map, there is a section called <b>Placeholders</b>. This shows the number of placeholders within the document that need attention.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/55.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can cycle through the placeholders by left-clicking on the button, which will take you to the first placeholder. When you click the placeholder, it will highlight the section that needs attention. In this example, the first placeholder is to select the date of the engagement letter.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/56.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Selecting the date will display a calendar from which you can choose the engagement letter date. Once the date has been selected, you will notice that the placeholder now shows 17 remaining. The next placeholder is for the "Person to whom the engagement letter is sent." This will provide a list of contacts for the entity and also allow you to add a contact.</p>
        <p>Cycle through each of the placeholders to add the necessary information. Any of the text within the document can also be modified or deleted. To modify the text, click on the paragraph to open an editor that allows you to make changes.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/57.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Some of the information in the text is highlighted in grey. This text is based on your previous user inputs and is generated using a formula. For example, if you click on "we" in the first sentence, it will show the reason for using "we."</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/58.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In this case, if the firm is not operated as a sole proprietorship, the output changes to "we" instead of "I." This can be overridden by typing "I" over "we." Be careful when doing this, as it will also change all other instances of "we" to "I." If you want to change only this one instance, place your cursor next to the formula, backspace to remove it, and then add the desired text.</p>
        <p>When in edit mode, you might also see places labeled <b>Formula</b>. These are placeholders for sections that have not been completed. In this example, we see <b>Formula</b> in front of <b>financial statements</b>. This formula would be used if we had selected that the financial statements are consolidated. If yes had been selected, you would then be asked which terminology to use, such as consolidated vs. combined. Since this selection was never made, the formula appears. This will not appear in the finished document.</p>
        <p>New sections can also be added to the document. If you place your cursor between two paragraphs, a plus sign will appear.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/59.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the plus sign to see a list of options that can be added.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/60.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>1-250Q Terms of engagement - Engagement letter - Query</h3>
        <p>Once the draft is complete and ready to send to the client for review and approval, go to document 1-250Q Terms of engagement - Engagement letter - Query. You can access this document from the link at the bottom of the page or by going back to the <b>Documents</b> tab and selecting it from the list. This document contains a draft of the letter being sent to the client.</p>
        <p>If you select the PDF link, it will take you back to the previous document for editing. At the bottom of the document, it shows where the document will be stored when it is returned from the client, namely in Terms of engagement - Engagement letter - Signed document.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/61.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When the letter is ready to be signed, select <b>Send</b> in the upper right corner.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/62.png" />
        </p>
        <p>This opens an Open Query dialog where you select the <b>Query Due Date</b>, assign it to the client contact responsible for approving the document, and enter an email body if needed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/63.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once this is completed, click <b>OK</b> to send the document to the client through the Caseware portal. The client will receive an email notifying them that they have something waiting in the portal.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/64.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/65.png" />
        </p>
        <p>They should click <b>View Details</b> or log into the portal directly. In the portal overview, it will show the item that needs the client's attention.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/66.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Click on the subject to open the document. Please note that the document may take a few seconds to open in the browser. The engagement letter query will appear like this for the client.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/67.png" />
        </p>
        <p>They can click on the PDF icon to view the document. They may also print it out to review a hard copy or review it on their computer screen. Once they are satisfied with the document, they can approve it electronically by selecting the <b>Action required</b> link.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/68.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If the client has printed and signed the document, they should select <b>Upload signed document</b>. If they wish to sign it electronically, they should select <b>Accept electronically</b> from the options. This will open a form where the client can enter additional comments if desired. Once they are ready, they should select <b>Accept</b> to return the document and then select <b>Submit Response</b>. The client's portal will show that the document was signed electronically and that the response has been submitted.</p>
        <p>Form 1-250Q will be updated to show that the client has responded to one or more questions. The form will now indicate that the document has been signed electronically.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/69.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The auditor then has the option to accept the document, in which case it will be placed in document 1-250R, or to return it to the client if something is missing or additional information is needed. Once <b>Accept</b> has been selected, 1-250Q is updated to show that the document has been accepted.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/70.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can select document 1-250R from the Documents tab. It will show the returned document and indicate that it was signed electronically.</p>
        <h2>Initial client queries and opening balances</h2>
        <p>The next section covers some initial client queries, specifically obtaining the trial balance, general ledger, financial statements, and information about the entity.</p>
        <h3>1-300Q Financial data and general entity information queries and responses</h3>
        <p>The first checklist in this section is the 1-300Q. Since it has a <b>Q</b>, it is a query checklist that includes a list of requests for the client, covering financial information and entity structure. This query contains multiple requests that will be sent to the client once completed. If you do not want to send any of the queries, you can select the eyeball icon next to the request.</p>
        <p>To see the eyeball icon, place your cursor in the upper right-hand corner of the query, click on it, and select <b>Hide</b> so that it is not sent to the client. At the bottom of the query, you can also see where the information will be stored. For the trial balance, it will be saved in Trial Balance - PBC, which is 1-305R.d.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/71.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Import the trial balance</h3>
        <p>To import the trial balance, select the <b>Data</b> tab at the top of the page, then select <b>Datasets</b> on the left-hand side. This will bring you to the import screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/72.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There are multiple ways to obtain the data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>From Excel or text file using drag and drop or the browse option.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From client queries using the <b>Import from Documents</b> option.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Using data connectors. Currently, there are four listed, but more are being added regularly. These allow you to connect directly to the application and retrieve the data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Validis</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>QuickBooks Online</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Xero</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Desktop Accounting Software</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From an existing engagement using either <b>Import from Working Papers</b> or <b>Import from Caseware Cloud engagement</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this example, we have obtained an Excel spreadsheet that will be imported into the engagement. To bring the spreadsheet in, locate it in the explorer and drag and drop it onto the appropriate area, or click to open the browser and find the file manually.</p>
        <p>Once the file is selected, you must indicate whether it is the trial balance or the general ledger. In this case, it is the trial balance.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/73.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Next, select whether this is the final trial balance or the planning trial balance. There is also an option to change the header row in case the header is not on the first line.</p>
        <p>Select <b>Upload</b> to load the file. Depending on the file size, this may take a few minutes. Once the file has been uploaded, select the <b>Configure</b> button to proceed to the <b>Assign Fields for Final Balance</b> page.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/74.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Assign fields</h3>
        <p>On the <b>Assign Fields for Final Balance</b> page, you are telling OnPoint Audit what type of information is contained in each field so that it knows how to handle the data.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/75.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You assign the fields by clicking on the dropdown and selecting the appropriate field type. In the example below, we are selecting <b>Account number</b> for the account number field. This process should be repeated for each field.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/76.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/77.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once the fields have been assigned, select the <b>Import</b> button at the bottom right of the page. The <b>Datasets</b> section will now show that the trial balance has been imported.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/78.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Next, select <b>Accounts</b> from the left-hand side.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/79.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the upper right-hand corner, you will see the net income for the imported trial balance, along with several other options.
</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/80.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The first icon allows you to save the current view.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The plus sign allows you to add an account or an adjustment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The next option allows you to assign accounts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The final option allows you to export the data.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Assign accounts</h3>
        <p>This is where any accounts will be assigned. You are matching the accounts imported from the trial balance to the OnPoint Audit accounts. In this example, the cash amount of $146 was not matched to a proper account.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/81.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There are several ways to assign an account. The first method is to drag the unassigned account over the financial groups. For example, if you drag the cash account over <b>Current Assets</b>, it will expand the group. You can then drag it over <b>Cash and Cash Equivalents</b>, and finally over <b>Cash</b>, where you release the unassigned account to assign it.</p>
        <p>Another method is to highlight the unassigned account and then select the appropriate account in the financial groups. In this case, if <b>Cash</b> is selected, an option will appear to assign the account.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/82.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Click <b>Assign</b>, and the cash account will be assigned accordingly.</p>
        <p>If a mistake is made and an account is not assigned properly, you can select the account and choose the option to unassign it. You can then reassign it to the correct account.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Financial groups</h3>
        <p>It is possible to create additional financial groups, as the financial groups needed for your client might not currently exist. To create a financial group, select the plus sign in the upper right corner. Then select the <b>Add group</b> option.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/85.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There are two fields that need to be completed: the number and the name. The number is the group reference number and must be unique. In this example, we will add a Canadian bank account to the <b>Cash equivalents</b> section. The number cannot contain any spaces and may only include letters, periods, or dashes.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/86.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Next, assign it a parent group. This allows the new group to roll up within the financial statements. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/87.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There are also other grouping options available, such as non-departmental income statement, group type, breakdown by dimension, and area.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/88.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once all the information has been entered, select <b>Save</b>. If you return to <b>Assign Accounts</b>, the Canadian bank account is now available and appears under <b>Cash equivalents</b>.</p>
        <p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Issues can be created at the engagement level, document level, or for specific questions within a document. The creation process is the same in all three scenarios. Select the <b>Issues</b> icon to open the issue form, where you can enter a description and choose the issue type from the dropdown menu.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/95.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can flag a person within the issue by using the <b>@</b> symbol, which opens a user list so you can tag the appropriate person(s).

For engagement-level issues, the <b>Issue</b> button is located in the upper left corner next to the name of the entity.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/96.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Document-level issues can be added in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>From the Documents tab by highlighting the document and selecting the flag icon.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="Images/97.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From within a document, where the Issue icon is found in the upper right corner along with other icons.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="Images/98.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For issues within a document, hover over the question and the <b>Issue</b> icon will appear.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/99.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can identify the presence of an issue by a red number next to the flag icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Issue_unresolved_icon.png" />). This number indicates how many issues exist for the engagement, document, or item.</p>
        <p>To view all issues in one place, select the <b>Issues</b> tab.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/100.png" />
        </p>
        <p>This will list all issues, which you can filter by type or status. It also displays the number of each type of issue. In this example, there are 2 <b>To dos</b> and 1 <b>Note</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/101.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Within each issue, you can choose to reply, resolve, clear, edit, or delete. Selecting <b>Resolve</b> or <b>Clear</b> will update the issue's status accordingly.</p>

        <p>The risk library is a library of risks that can be imported into the engagement. To access the risk library, select the <b>Risk Library</b> button.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/110.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The risk library is divided into financial statement and assertion risks.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/111.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The assertion risks are further broken down into the following cycles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Payroll</p>

                <p>Inventory</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The financial statement risks are grouped into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>IT Risks</p>
            </li>

                <p>Financial Statement Risks</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To add risks from the risk library to the engagement, select individual risks and save them. For example, we will select the <b>Revenue, Receivables, Receipts</b> cycle from the assertion risks.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/112.png" />
        </p>
        <p>This will filter the risks to show only those related to Revenue, Receivables, and Receipts. Each cycle contains several sections covering different risk areas. For example, within this cycle, there is a section for invoices/sales risks.</p>

        <p>Document 3-3025 Control Implementation - Assertion level controls is a checklist that ensures the control assertions were properly reviewed.</p>
        <p>Depending on the business processes selected, there will be sections where the process narratives can be attached for each business process. These are documents 3-310 to 3-420.</p>

        <h1>Materiality</h1>
        <p>The Materiality template allows you to determine overall materiality and the performance materiality required to reduce, to an acceptably low level, the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected or undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality.</p>
        <p>This document is broken down into the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Principal users of the financial statements</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Overall materiality</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Qualitative disclosures</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Performance materiality</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Trivial misstatement</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Materiality for specific circumstances</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Performance materiality for specific circumstances</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Principal users of the financial statements</h2>
        <p>This section allows for the listing of the principal users of the financial statements and any factors to consider for these users.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/123.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Overall materiality</h2>
        <p>This section allows for calculating possible materialities based on different scenarios. By default, the <b>Revenue</b>, <b>Assets</b>, and <b>Accounts</b> fields will be populated with the current and prior year amounts. A benchmark percentage can then be applied. Clicking the lightbulb icon next to the <b>Overall materiality</b> title will display additional documentation, including suggested benchmark percentages.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/124.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If the maximum percentage is used for each benchmark, the following would result:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/125.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In this instance, an auditor might select $200,000 as the planning materiality based on the assets. This amount would be entered into the planning materiality field and would then appear in the upper right-hand corner under <b>Net Income</b>.</p>
        <p><a href="Images/127.png"><img src="Images/126.png" /><img src="Images/127.png" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>There are also other options for estimating materiality. It can be based on another financial materiality basis, a custom formula, or another relevant basis.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/128.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Qualitative disclosures</h2>
        <p>This section allows you to add factors that could result in a material misstatement in qualitative disclosures.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/129.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Performance materiality</h2>
        <p>Performance materiality is the amount or amounts set by the auditor at less than materiality for the financial statements as a whole, to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.</p>
        <p>If applicable, performance materiality also refers to the amount or amounts set by the auditor at less than the materiality level or levels for particular classes of transactions, account balances, or disclosures.</p>
        <p>Set performance materiality at an amount that is based on, but lower than, overall materiality (for example, between 50-75% of overall materiality). Use professional judgment based on expectations of misstatements that could arise in the current period. Consider business and fraud risks identified, results of performing risk assessment procedures, and the nature and extent of misstatements identified in previous audits.</p>
        <p>Entering the benchmark percentage applied will update the planning materiality as well as update the materiality shown in the upper right corner.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/130.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/131.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Trivial misstatement</h2>
        <p>Trivial misstatements represent misstatements which, in the auditor's judgment, are not material to the financial statements, either individually or when aggregated with other such misstatements, even after considering the possibility of further undetected misstatements.</p>
        <p>The auditor should accumulate misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that are clearly trivial.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/132.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Materiality for specific circumstances</h2>
        <p>This section is for financial statements that require a lower level of materiality. It addresses specific user expectations that call for a materiality level lower than overall materiality for certain areas.</p>
        <p>This materiality can be based on financial materiality, specific financial areas, or another relevant basis.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/133.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Performance materiality for specific circumstances</h2>
        <p>The Performance materiality for specific circumstances section calculates performance materiality based on the Materiality for specific circumstances section.</p>
        <h1>Financial statement areas worksheet</h1>
        <p>The Financial statement areas worksheet includes one document. This document links to the <b>Risk &amp; controls</b> tab and displays the financial statement-level risks. It breaks down the financial statements by category, showing the RMM (risk of material misstatement) for each item, the current year (CY) and prior year (PY) balances, along with the variance. It also includes links to the associated procedures.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/134.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Selecting the name of any item will open a form that displays the assertions, allowing the auditor to assess them based on completeness, existence, accuracy, valuation, and presentation and disclosure.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/135.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There is an option in the upper right corner to exclude the item, along with a link to the analysis for that financial statement area.</p>

        <h1>Audit strategy</h1>
        <h2>Overall audit strategy - 4-300</h2>
        <p>This document is used to outline the scope, timing, and direction of the audit as a guide for developing the audit plan. It covers the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>General considerations</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reporting requirements</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Timing of engagement</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Engagement team resources and budgets</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Proposed risk assessment procedures and audit approach</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use of an auditor's specialist</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use of a service organization</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Specified parties</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Communication of overall audit strategy</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Records and documents queries - 4-300Q</h2>
        <p>This document contains a large number of queries. The queries that appear will depend on the level of RMM and whether the item is material. It will only display queries that are material and meet certain conditions, which vary based on the financial statement section.</p>
        <p>For example, the Cash &amp; cash equivalents schedule will only appear as a query if any conditions within that group are met. These conditions are set in the <b>Risk &amp; controls</b> tab, under the <b>Assessment</b> section.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/138.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The sections on External audit specialist (4-400) and Use of service organization (4-460) are hidden unless document 4-300 Overall audit strategy indicates that they will be used.</p>
        <h2>Team planning discussion - Brainstorming - 4-500</h2>
        <p>This document is intended to ensure appropriate communication among the engagement team, resulting in a well-planned audit.</p>
        <p>The document focuses on risk response planning. There is also document 4-520, which is an Excel spreadsheet that can be used to enter the time budget for the engagement.</p>
        <h2>Firm and client deliverables - 4-650</h2>
        <p>This document is a client information letter. It contains three sections: the draft, the query (which will be sent to the client), and the signed letter once it has been returned by the client.</p>
        <h2>Audit planning letter - 4-750</h2>
        <p>This section provides a sample planning letter, offering a suggested form of communication regarding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The auditor's responsibilities in relation to the financial statement audit</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The planned scope and timing of the audit</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This section also includes three documents: the draft letter, the query, and a placeholder for the signed letter once it is returned.</p>
        <h2>Planning overview - 4-900</h2>
        <p>The Planning Overview allows reviewers to assess the progressive completion of requirements during engagement planning and to ensure that key areas have been addressed.</p>
        <p>The overview is broken down into the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Firm's client acceptance/continuance policies</p>

        <h1>Test of controls</h1>
        <p>The documents listed in this section will depend on the business cycles selected in document 4-300 Overall audit strategy - Test of controls - Sampling. If no business cycles have been selected for control testing, all the documents will be hidden.</p>
        <p>These documents provide guidance on the use of tests of controls in evaluating the operating effectiveness of controls at the assertion level. They are broken down into the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The basics</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Other considerations</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Planning the test - Determining sample size</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sample selection</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Perform audit procedures</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Evaluate results</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Conclusion</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For each business cycle selected, there will be a worksheet for Test of controls - Sampling and results. This document lists any controls that have been documented to mitigate the associated assertion risk. Controls can be added through the <b>Risk &amp; controls</b> tab or by clicking the <img src="../../Resources/Icons/NewEngagementIcon.png" /> in the upper right-hand corner, which allows you to create a new risk or control.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/139.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When selecting <b>Control</b>, a form will appear with the following fields:</p>

                <p>Classification - Preventative or Detective</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Key Control - Yes or No</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Effect - Direct or Indirect</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/140.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/141.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The controls are listed in the Controls section of the <b>Risk &amp; controls</b> tab, where they can be added or updated.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/142.png" />

        <p>These controls populate the Test of controls - Sampling and results document.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/144.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Within this document, you can further define what constitutes a deviation, and in the <b>Test control</b> column, indicate when the control was tested.</p>
        <h1>General audit procedures</h1>
        <p>The general audit procedures contain the following documents. Some of them may be hidden depending on previous choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Final overall analytics review - 6-100</p>
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Summary of external confirmations - 6-120</p>
                <p>An Excel worksheet that allows tracking of external confirmations.</p>

                <p>Used to determine whether the work of an auditor's specialist is adequate for the auditor's purposes.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Journal entries</h1>
        <p>This section is divided into three parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>6-200 - Testing of journal entries</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>6-210 - Transactions import</p>
                <p>Links to the data tab and allows the import of general ledger transactions, which can then be used as part of testing in the Analytics Hub tab.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>6-220 - Data completeness</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Importing the GL</h2>
        <p>To import the journal entries, select document 6-210, then go to the <b>Data</b> tab and select <b>Datasets</b>. In the Datasets section, click <b>Add data</b>. See the section Importing the Trial Balance for reference. The difference in this case is that you will select <b>General Ledger</b> as the dataset type.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/145.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The next step is tagging the fields. This is done the same way as for the trial balance. The only exception is if the file includes a document type. If it does, you will need to map the different document types accordingly.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/146.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once the journal entry data has been imported, you will be able to perform tests through the Analytics Hub or by using document 6-200 Testing of journal entries.</p>
        <h2>Analytics Hub</h2>
        <p>The Analytics Hub can be accessed through the Analytics Hub tab. This provides access to all analytical tests.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/147.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The analytical tests can also be accessed through document 6-200. There is an additional icon next to many of the items in the document. By clicking on this icon, you can access the analytical tests related to that step.</p>
        <p>For example, if you select the icon for significant changes in monetary amounts, you will be taken to the Analytics Hub, where the relevant tests will be displayed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/148.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/149.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Selecting a test will open the documentation and configuration section, where you can configure the test.  For instance, if the JE-High value amount test is selected, you will see an explanation of the test and a section for configuration.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/150.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/151.png" />
        </p>
        <p>For this test, you must select a numeric field (<b>Amount</b>, in this case) and enter a high-value threshold. In this example, the test will extract all transactions greater than 10,000. Different tests will have different configuration options.</p>
        <p>You can also filter the dataset so that the test is only run on a portion of the data rather than the entire dataset.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/152.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The analytical details section provides the purpose of the test.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/153.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Finally, there is the linkage section.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/154.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once one or more tests have been selected, click <b>Run</b> to start the analysis. When the analysis is complete, the <b>Status</b> section will update with a green checkmark and a success message next to the test.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/155.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/156.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Results</b> tab will also become available.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/157.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Instead of running analytics by group, you can select the <b>Analytics Hub</b> to run all analytics as a batch using the default configuration. You can also update the configuration for any of the tests as needed.</p>

        <p>Each section will have an audit procedures document, which is usually the X.100 document. Depending on the financial statement area, it may also include an accounting estimate document, query documents such as bank confirmations, substantive analytical procedures, and other special documents that relate specifically to that financial statement area.</p>
        <p>Within the audit procedures document, there are four tabs: <b>Procedures</b>, <b>Analysis</b>, <b>Risk</b>, and <b>Guidance</b>. The <b>Procedures</b> section will walk you through the following areas:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>The Planned Response section includes the Audit Response Table (ART). This table helps determine the appropriate nature, extent, and variation of audit procedures to address each relevant assertion. In this table, you will review the summary of proposed audit responses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Yellow Warning:</b> Indicates a risk of overauditing due to procedures being included but not selected in the ART.</p>
