        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">What is PBC Requests?</h1>
        <p>Caseware Provided By Client (PBC) Requests is a solution that's exclusively designed to address staff-client collaboration. It offers a unified interface where you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Request information and documents from clients</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Track clients activity on each requested item</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Simply and effectively provide and receive feedback or comments</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Perform all the above within Caseware Cloud secure hub</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The default content that comes with PBC Requests can be used in client collaboration cases that are part of a Canadian assurance engagement. For example, gather information from clients as part of the annual assurance, review or compliance engagements.</p>
        <p>Firms and staff members can customize the default content to meet specific firm or client requirements.</p>
        <p>PBC Requests can also directly integrate with Working Papers to be used as an add-on to a desktop engagement file. </p>
        <h3>About this guide</h3>
        <p>The practice aids in this guide have been designed for a small- and medium-sized non-public company. They do not address the wide range of circumstances or specific industry issues that may exist for a particular client or groups of clients (such as those operating in a specialized industry, government or non-profit organization or complex IT environments). Consequently, the forms should always be tailored to address the known facts and circumstances of each engagement. </p>
