        <h1>Process mining home screen</h1>
        <p>The process flow diagram at the top of the home screen shows how the data flows through the various processes in the PPP (Purchases, Payables, Payments) cycle. Each block in the process has a specific document type associated with it. For example, PR type data entries are associated with the Purchase Requisition block.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If your data import failed, an error message displays and the home screen will be blank. If this happens, reimport your data.</p>
