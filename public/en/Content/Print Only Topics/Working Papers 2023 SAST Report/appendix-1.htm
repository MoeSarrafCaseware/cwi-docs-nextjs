        <h1>Appendix 1</h1>
        <h2>October 2023 update (1.1)</h2>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>We conducted an update on Dependabot findings. Since Semgrep findings are enforced in pull requests, we didn’t update these.</p>
        <h3>Changed findings</h3>
        <p>Because the Chromium version is updated, new findings were added and existing ones were solved. Some findings for QBExport and XeroSDK were solved and removed from the report.</p>
        <h3>Clarified times</h3>
        <p>We clarified some of the timelines for security findings, as well as added a state to all of them.</p>
