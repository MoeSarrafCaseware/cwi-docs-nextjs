        <p>During initial setup, if your firm has <a href="../../Explore/MyCaseware/Purchase-and-manage-a-Caseware-Cloud-license.htm">purchased licenses</a> on a per user basis, staff members will be automatically assigned to available apps in Cloud. If necessary, firm administrators can manually reassign app access for groups or individual users. In most cases, enabling apps for groups is the most efficient way to manage access. When you enable an app for a group, each member of that group uses a license for that app. For example, you can enable an app for the <b>All Staff</b> group, immediately giving every member access to that app. You still need a license for each group member.</p>
        <p>You can also manage app access and permissions on an individual basis. You might do this if you want to enable certain apps for a single user. For example, if your organization hires consultants, you might want to grant them full access to some apps, read-only access to others, and restrict their access to some apps entirely.</p>
        <p class="note">
            <b>Note:</b> You can only reassign staff once. If you assign staff incorrectly and require assistance with reassignment, contact our <a href="mailto:support@caseware.com">Support team</a>.</p>
