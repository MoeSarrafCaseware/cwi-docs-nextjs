        <p>Complete <b>D100 Evaluation of misstatements identified</b> to document misstatements identified during the audit and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements (including those in qualitative financial statement disclosures) on the audit, and the effect of uncorrected misstatements, if any, on the financial statements.</p>
        <p>Select your preferred method of documentation (<b>Narrative</b> or <b>Procedures</b>) for each section. When you have completed your work, select the <b>Hide</b> button in the Conclusion area to hide the desired documentation decisions. As with other documents your responses in this checklist determine other documents that you need to complete. For example, if you select <i>Procedure</i> for the <b>Preferred documentation</b> question in the <b>Changes to materiality  for any revisions required</b> section, you are prompted to update <b>A500 Materiality</b>.</p>
        <p>When you complete <b>D200 Summary of Misstatements</b>, remember to ask those charged with governance to correct any misstatements not already corrected by management.</p>
