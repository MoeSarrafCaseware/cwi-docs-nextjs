        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> Do not forget to save your excel file once you're done. If you want to share a copy of the current excel file and do not want the data to update as the engagement file is updated, you can use the <b>Duplicate &amp; Unlink</b> option. This will create a copy of the spreadsheets that does not include formulas which you can use to backup information or send it to clients. Note that protected sheets cannot be duplicated.</p>
