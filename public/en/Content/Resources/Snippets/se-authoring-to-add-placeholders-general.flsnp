        <p>You can add placeholders for text and fields to prompt users to insert specific information related to the engagement, organization or client. For example, you can add a date placeholder to prompt accountants to add today's date as part of the content.</p>
        <p>You can also add logo placeholders. Once users upload their firm logo, it automatically replaces the logo placeholders that you've set in the document.</p>
