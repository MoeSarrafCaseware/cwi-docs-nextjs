            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Financials new design</h2>
        <h3>Authoring</h3>
        <p>Authors can now add guidance information in the Financial Statements document.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>Add Guidance</b> menu option is now available for areas, text sections, dynamic tables and notes. Users can turn the guidance information on or off using the lightbulb icon next to the area or text section or table.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A new <b>Guidance</b> area is also now available to add general guidance information in the document.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You can now have a 3-level notes list by adding second level (Heading1) and third level (Heading2) notes. If you delete a note, all headings and content within this note are also deleted. Note that third level notes don't show in the Document Map unless you expand their respective second level notes (parent notes) in the document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The notes library now displays notes based on hierarchy (sublevel notes or main notes). You can traverse the hierarchy of the displayed notes by selecting <b>View note.</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you add a note from library, a blue indicator now shows next to the newly added note in the Document Map. The blue indicator disappears once you select the note.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dynamic tables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You now have the option to edit note references in a row or column. You can also navigate to the referenced note (in the <b>Notes to the Financial Statements area</b>) to view or edit its content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>Description</b> column can now show account numbers in addition to the account name and total. Note that authors must enable this feature in the product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A new table format is now available to support the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Statement of Changes In Equity (SOCIE). The new format flips the table to have dimensions as rows and trial balance groups as columns.</p>
            </li>
            <p>Note that any existing setup and information is lost once the table format is changed. Authors need to redo any existing table setup if they switch to IFRS/SOCIE format.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Visibility settings</h3>
        <p>In the Financial Statements, you now get a confirmation prompt if you attempt to exclude content that's available due to visibility settings. The prompt shows the details of the response conditions logic and provides a link to the checklist document so you can review and change responses if needed.</p>
        <p>Note that currently, this feature is only available for visibility settings based on response conditions.</p>
