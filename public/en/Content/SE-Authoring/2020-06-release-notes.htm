        <h1>SE 2020-06 release notes</h1>
        <p>During this unprecedented situation, while adjusting to a new mode of operation, juggling work and family or general uncertainty,  the Cloud Engagements team unyieldingly delivers.
</p>
        <p>SE 2020-06 is packed with features and enhancements; standing taller than its predecessor releases in this year.
</p>
        <h2>Flipped sign indicator</h2>
        <p><a href="End-user.htm">#enduser</a> <a href="Primary-author.htm"> #primaryauthor</a> <a href="Firm-author.htm"> #firmauthor</a></p>
        <p>When you change the default sign of an account in dynamic tables, an indicator (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-flipped-sign-indicator.png" style="width: 42px;height: 30px;vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) now displays in the row. </p>
        <p>From end users perspective, balances for rows with flipped sign no longer display in italics to indicate that this row has an opposite sign. The new Flipped Sign indicator (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-flipped-sign-indicator.png" style="width: 42px;height: 30px;vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) displays in the row instead. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Edit-table-rows-in-the-financial-statements.htm">Edit table rows in the financial statements</a>.</p>

        <h2>Watermark in print settings</h2>
        <p><a href="End-user.htm">#enduser</a> <a href="Primary-author.htm"> #primaryauthor</a> <a href="Firm-author.htm"> #firmauthor</a></p>

        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/watermark-setting.png" alt="Apply watermark option in the document print settings." />
        </p>
        <p>To complement this feature, the <b>Print</b> (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-print-financial-statement.PNG" style="width: 34px;height: 27px;vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) icon in the financial statements now displays two options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Print Preview</b> - Launches a print preview of the PDF output.</p>
            </li>
            <p>Note that the print settings (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-settings-in-print-preview.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 23px;height: 23px;" />) are also accessible in the print preview mode. You can make changes in settings and view them without having to close the print preview page and navigate back to the financial statements document.</p>
            <p>In the print preview page, you can also select the print icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-print-in-Financials-PDF.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 30px;height: 30px;" />) to print the document or the downward arrow (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-download-PDF-in-preview.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 22px;height: 24px;" />) to download the PDF.</p>
            <li>

        <h2>New for authors</h2>
        <p>Here is what's new for authors in SE 2020-06.</p>
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a>
        </p>
        <p>You can now group components. Component categories are now available in the Product Settings so you can further organize the components in your product for multiple industries, entity types or reporting frameworks. </p>
        <p>Note that with component categories now available, you can no longer add standalone components. You must create one category at least for the <b>+Component</b> option to be available in the dialog. To learn more, see <a href="Define-components.htm">Define components.</a></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/component-categories.PNG" alt="Example of component categories." />
        </p>
        <p>To complement this feature, the Group Properties dialog now includes a new property <b>Component Category</b>. Once you assign one or more categories to a trial balance group, they are included in the dialog, so you can assign the applicable components.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> You can assign components from different categories to the same trial balance group.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="Group-properties.htm#Componen2">Component Categories</a> and <a href="Group-properties.htm#Componen">Components.</a></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/components-in-a-category.PNG" alt="User selects Manufacturing and Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting categories. Notice how they are included in the dialog once selected." />
        </p>
        <h3>Financial statements</h3>
        <p><a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a>
        </p>
        <p>Firm authors can now view the print settings for the predefined areas and page breaks in financial statements, as well as make changes to it if needed.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> Predefined areas and page breaks are those that have been authored in the product template. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Manage-the-firm-template.htm">Manage the firm template</a>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/page-break-print-settings-FA.png" alt="Print Settings option in predefined page breaks in the firm template." />
        </p>
        <h3>Data links (formulas)</h3>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a> <a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a></p>
        <p>A new setting <b>Medium date</b> is now available in the Product Settings dialog, so you can customize the medium date format for the <b>Engagement Properties</b> data links.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/meduim-date-in-prod-settings.PNG" alt="Authors can now customize the medium date format." />
        </p>
        <h3>Queries</h3>
        <p><a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a>
        </p>
        <p>A new option <b>Show Author ID</b> is now available in the firm template for predefined query questions. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/copy-authorID-new-query.png" alt="Show Author ID option." />
        </p>
        <p>Instead of previously, having to suppress and re-create existing query questions and responses, the <b>Show Author ID</b> option displays a dialog where firm authors can copy existing author IDs.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Copy-authorID-button.png" alt="Firm authors can simply copy existing response author ID." />
        </p>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Predefined query questions are questions that have been authored in the product template</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Firms that do not have a firm template but still want to copy author IDs to integrate with Working Papers must create a draft template so they can copy the author IDs. Once they copy the IDs,  they can select <b>Delete Draft</b> to delete the firm template they have just created. To learn more about the firm template workflow, see <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Manage-the-firm-template.htm">Manage the firm template</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This feature is available in the old and new query layout</p>

        <h2>New for end users</h2>
        <p>Here is what's new for <a href="End-user.htm">end users</a> in SE 2020-06.</p>
        <h3>Checklists</h3>
        <p>Query questions linked to checklist procedures have witnessed a couple of enhancements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If the linked query question is hidden in the query document, its responses no longer display beneath the procedure in the checklist document. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Files uploaded by clients now display as links, so users can directly access them. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/query-file-in-checklist.png" alt="Files uploaded by clients now display as links. Previously, users would only see the filename. " />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data page</h3>
        <p>A new import option <b>Engagement File</b> is now available in the <b>Import</b> tab.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> You must enable the <b>Engagement File</b> import option in your product, otherwise it will not be available to users. To enable the <b>Engagement File</b> import option, add the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">"com.caseware.import.engagementfile"</span> module to  the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">"imports"</span> array in the product.json file.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/engagement-file-import-option.png" alt="Engagement File import option on the Data page." />
        </p>
        <p>Once the option is enabled, users can import a trial balance from another engagement file. Note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Users can only select one engagement file to import from</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To import from an engagement file that belongs to a different Cloud Engagements app, users must be granted access to that app and the entity that the file belongs to. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Setup/Users-and-Groups/Set-staff-access-levels.htm">Set staff access levels</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Users cannot map the data between the source and destination engagements. For example, the Current Year data column from the source engagement is automatically imported to the Current Year column in the destination engagement</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once the data is imported, the year-end date for the destination engagement is automatically set to match the year-end date of the source engagement</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Existing annotations and issues in the source data are not imported</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Importing from a consolidation engagement imports the <i>parent entity data</i> only into the destination engagement</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the source and destination groupings don't match or partially match, unassigned accounts will populate in the <b>Assign Accounts</b> tab and users must manually assign them. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Accounts-and-Analysis/Assign-accounts-to-groups-in-the-Data-page.htm">Assign accounts to groups in the Data page</a></p>

        </p>
        <h3>Financial statements</h3>
        <p>Eliminating adjustments are now included in the Account Details popup in consolidation engagements.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Queries</h3>
        <p>SE 2020-06 brings in carry forward support in the new query layout and more security measures for file exchange.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Contacts can no longer upload suspicious files in File Uploads responses (such as .com, .bat, .exe, .cmd, .sh, .dll, .so, .o, .deb, .msi, .rpm, .ko, .sys, .php). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Carry forward is now available for the queries new layout. </p>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>XBRL review</h3>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> This feature is only available for distributor testing only. It will not be deployed to partner or production environments.</p>
        <p>Text sections are now included in XBRL review in financial statements. Once users start the review process, a dashed green border marks text sections and the fact details display in the <b>XBRL REVIEW</b> pane so they can review and validate the data.</p>
        <p>Note that data links (fx) are underlined in green. If users select a data link, its fact details display in the <b>XBRL REVIEW</b> pane.</p>

            <img src="../Resources/Images/text-section-xbrl-review.PNG" alt="Text sections marked with a dashed-green border. Fact details display in the XBRL REVIEW pane." />
        </p>
        <p>XBRL review has also witnessed functionality enhancements related to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Navigating to other documents after users start the XBRL review</p>
                <p> If users navigate to a document that is not part of the selected taxonomy, the XBRL review processes automatically stops. Note that if users restart the review process, they pick up where they left off. That is, the last document they have been reviewing opens with the last selected fact s displayed in the <b>XBRL REVIEW</b> pane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Changing the selected taxonomy after users start the XBRL review</p>
                <p> If users select a different taxonomy, the first document in that taxonomy opens. The first fact configured in that document displays by default in the <b>XBRL REVIEW</b> pane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Disabling actions in the document users are currently reviewing</p>
                <p>Once users start the XBRL review process, the only action they can perform in the document is to create or edit issues (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-issues-in-document-inline.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />). All other actions are disabled.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
