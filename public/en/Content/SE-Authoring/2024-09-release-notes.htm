        <h2>Enterprise authoring</h2>
        <p><a href="Network-author.htm">#enterpriseauthor</a>
        </p>
        <p>SE 2024-09 features the official launch of the enterprise author role.</p>
        <p>The enterprise author role enables accountancy enterprises and associations, as well as large firms with multiple offices, to customize product templates provided by primary authors and share those templates with all their member firms. This allows accountancy networks to easily maintain a standard methodology across their member firms, while still giving member firms the flexibility to make further customizations as required for their region.</p>
        <p>To manage the enterprise firm template in a central location, accountancy enterprises will have a Cloud site specifically for enterprise authoring in addition to Cloud sites for each of the member firms in the enterprise. Users from the member firms that the enterprise wants to designate as enterprise authors can be added to the enterprise authoring firm site.</p>
        <p>In the enterprise authoring firm, enterprise authors can access the template provided by primary authors on the Manage template page in their settings. From this page, they can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Create a draft and make customizations to the template</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Save the template so they can test it</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Publish the template and make it available to all the member firms in their enterprise</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Restore previous versions of the template</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> Any customizations made by enterprise authors cannot be overridden by new updates made to the product template by primary authors.</p>
        <p>Once their work is complete, enterprise authors can then share this template with their member firms, where firm authors can make additional customizations. Note that member firms will always receive their templates from the enterprise authoring firm and not directly from primary authors.</p>
        <h3>Additional authoring capabilities</h3>
        <p>In addition to the features already available to firm authors, enterprise authors also have access to customize the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Risks</b>
                    <br />Enterprise authors have the ability to customize all items on the Assessment, Fields, and Scales tabs of the Risks section in the product settings. Note that while enterprise authors also have access to the General tab, the option to enable the new Risks page and the Library management section is still only available to primary authors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Controls</b>
                    <br />If controls are enabled by primary authors, enterprise authors can customize all controls settings. Note that they do not have the ability to disable controls.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Assertions</b>
                    <br />All items in the Assertions tab of the product settings are available to enterprise authors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Documents page</b>
                    <br />Enterprise authors can modify the names, identifiers and visibility settings of primary author-created documents, as well as reorder primary author-created folders and subfolders. They can also add, rename and reorder phases from the product settings dialog.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Checklists</b>
                    <br />Enterprise authors can modify visibility settings for items within a checklist and can also add annotations for procedures.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Translation for the financial statements</h2>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a><a href="End-user.htm">#enduser</a>
        </p>
        <p>You can now enable automatic machine translation for the financial statements. When you make this feature available in your product, users can translate text sections in the financial statements to any of the content languages available in your product.</p>
        <p>To enable this feature, select the <b>Enable translation</b> checkbox in the <b>Financial Statements</b> tab of the product settings and ensure you have more than one content language enabled in your template.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/ProductSettingsEnableTranslation.png" title="Product" alt="Enabling translations in the financial statements." />
        </p>
        <p>Users can then select the <b>Translation</b> option in the financial statements settings to enable translation for the document. The <b>Translation</b> icon then appears next to text sections in the document.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/TranslationExample.png" alt="Example of a financial statement with Translation icons." />
        </p>
        <p>When users select the translation icon, the <b>Translation</b> dialog opens. From this dialog, they can select which language to translate the content to, view the translation, and select <b>Save</b> to apply it to the text section.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/TranslationDialog.png" alt="Using the Translation dialog." />
        </p>
        <p>The translated version of the text section displays in the engagement when the user switches the content language of the engagement to the target language. They can then make manual edits to the text if required.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/TranslationExample.png" alt="Example of a translation in a financial statement." />

        <h2>Custom calculations in financial statement text sections</h2>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a><a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a><a href="Network-author.htm">#networkauthor</a><a href="End-user.htm">#enduser</a>
        </p>
        <p>You can now add custom calculations to text sections in the financial statements. Similarly to custom calculations in dynamic tables, you can reference trial balance values and dynamic table cells in your calculations. These calculations will update automatically if the referenced values change.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/NewArea.png" alt="Add custom calculations to text sections in financial statements. " />
        </p>
        <h2>Cell references within the financial statements</h2>

        </p>
        <p>This release introduces cell referencing within the financial statements. You can now reference values from one dynamic table into another. This eliminates the need to manually enter the same value multiple times in different tables in the financial statements.</p>
        <h2>Custom formulas for the Overall Materiality Table</h2>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a><a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a><a href="Network-author.htm">#networkauthor</a><a href="End-user.htm">#enduser</a>
        </p>
        <p>You can now use custom formulas in the Overall Materiality Table.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In the materiality document, you can now document materiality and performance materiality for specific circumstances for areas.</p>

        <h1><a name="New"></a>Authoring features</h1>
        <p>Here is what's new for authors in SE 2024-09. </p>
        <h2>
Set the ability to add groups from the product settings</h2>
        <p><a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a><a href="Network-author.htm">#networkauthor</a>
        </p>
        <p>Enterprise authors and firm authors can now determine if end users can add financial groups in engagements. While primary authors still retain the ability to define if this feature is available to end users in the product.json file, enterprise authors and firm authors can now override the primary author’s settings to customize their template.</p>
        <p>To determine whether end users can add financial groups, authors can modify the <b>Enable user-defined financial groups</b> checkbox on the <b>Data</b> tab of the product settings.</p>
        <p>Note that the <b>Enable user-defined financial groups</b> checkbox is also available to primary authors, so you can control whether end users can add financial groups without having to edit the product.json file.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h1><a name="New2"></a>End-user features</h1>
        <p>Here is what's new for end users in SE 2024-09.</p>
        <h2>Version control for the financial statements</h2>
        <p>Users can now save and compare previous versions of the financial statements. This allows users to keep better track of what changes are made to the document and by whom.</p>
        <p>To save a new version, they can select the <b>Version control</b> icon in the Document Map. They can then select <b>New</b> in the Version history panel to save a new version with a title and a description.</p>
        <p>To compare the current version of the financial statements with a previous version, they can use the checkboxes to select the previous version and then select <b>Compare</b>. The financial statements then display a comparison highlighting what content was added and deleted since the previous version.</p>
        <p>Note that changes made to the following items are not tracked:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>SE Builder tables</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Analysis charts</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Embedded images</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Embedded PDFs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Document settings</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users can also view and delete previous versions from the <b>More actions</b> menu for the version.</p>
        <h2>Issues for dynamic table rows</h2>
        <p>Users can now add issues to dynamic table rows. The Issues icon displays when users hover the cursor over the right side of a dynamic table row. They can then select the icon to add an issue.</p>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Issues added to a child row are displayed at the parent level when the group of rows is collapsed. When the row is expanded, the issues display at the row they were added to.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If a row should be hidden due to visibility logic, it will continue to display if an issue is attached to it and it is either outstanding or resolved.   The row will be hidden if the issue is cleared. Note that whether an issue is attached to a hidden row or not, that row will not be included when printing the document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If an issue is added to a row and the row is later deleted, the issue is moved to the dynamic table at the table level.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that issues cannot be added to page break rows.</p>
        <h2>Improvement to syncing trial balance</h2>
        <p>A warning message now displays to users when they attempt to sync their trial balance from another engagement. After they select the <b>Confirm</b> button, this new message displays and informs them that syncing the trial balance is an irreversible action.</p>
        <h2>Filter adjustments</h2>
        <p>A new <b>All types</b> dropdown is now available on the <b>Adjustments</b> page to allow users to filter adjustments by type. When users select to export their adjustments, only the filtered adjustments are included in the generated file. This allows users to select only the types of adjustments they need and provide a copy of them to their clients.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Dropdown-Filters.png" alt="Filtering adjustments by type.">
            </img>

        <h2>Saved views for the Data page</h2>
        <p>The Save views icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/SaveViewsIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"></img>) is now available on the Data page to allow users to save their current view and access previously saved views.</p>
        <p>When users save a view, their selections for the following settings are saved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Columns</p>
