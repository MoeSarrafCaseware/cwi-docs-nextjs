        <h1>New in SE 2025-02 </h1>
        <p>Welcome to SE 2025-02! This release introduces new numbered heading options for financial statements, the ability to open and edit PDFs locally and sync back to the Document Manager and the ability to enable/disable the <b>Sync trial balance</b> function from the data import workflow.</p>
        <p>To view the most recent fixes in this release, see the following:</p>

        </p>
        <p>Users can now choose whether note and area headings are numbered. In addition, the style of numbering can be customized per each individual Area or applied across the entire financial statement. The new option is available from the <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions-inline.png" alt=" " style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) menu for each Area.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In addition to being able to hide headings, users can now hide numbers that are applied to headings, including automatic numbering, for an individual heading. This feature is available from the <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions-inline.png" alt=" " style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) menu for each heading for the notes and text areas in the financial statements. The number will also be hidden in the Table of Contents should the heading be displayed.</p>

        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> This feature requires a one-time protocol installation and may not be available in your product.</p>
        <p>Users can now open PDF files that have been added to the engagement in using a standard PDF viewer or editor app installed on your machine. This includes the ability to comment on and highlight PDFs, enabling better collaboration on your engagements. Once users save the file, the edits they made will be synced to the file in the engagement. To learn more, refer to <a href="../Engagements/Documentation-and-Review/Attach-documents-to-an-engagement-file.htm#Open">Open and edit PDFs locally</a>.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <p><b>Note:</b> To include this feature, add the following to the features array in the <i>product.json</i>:</p>
            <p><code>"feature": {</code>
            </p>
            <p><code>"syncTrialBalance": false,</code>
            </p>
            <p>For more information, see <a href="https://developers.caseware.com/se-authoring/31/List-of-product-features-(API).htm#Trial">List of product features / Trial balance</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Primary authors can now enable or disable the <b>Sync trial balance</b> toggle from the engagement file import workflow.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The <b>Sync trial balance</b> function is, by default, enabled on all Caseware products that support engagement file imports. Since there are some use cases where this function should not be used, this enhancement allows the primary author to hide the function from the end user in the Engagement File import dialog.</p>
        <h2>Rounding setup recommendations</h2>
        <p>If you have rounding set up in <b>Format | Numbers</b> on Product Settings, there are recommendations for settings found in the <b>Features | Financial Statements</b> tab. To learn more, see <a href="Rounding-recommendations-author-side.htm">Rounding setup recommendations</a>.</p>
