        <h2>Group Audit initiative </h2>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a><a href="end-user.htm">#enduser</a>
        </p>
        <p class="note in line"><b>Note:</b> To enable this feature, select <b>Group Audit</b> from the <b>Features</b> list in <b>Product Settings</b> and click <b>Group Audit</b>.  </p>
        <p>The Group audit feature streamlines the use of common work areas within a group audit. This includes the ability to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Identify common work areas for various group audit components.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Share common work areas with component auditors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Adapt common work areas to engagements with evolving statutory standards and complex requirements</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users can now share common work areas, such as Risks, during a group audit within the same engagement. In addition, you can document specific performance materiality for each group audit components.</p>
        <p>As the initiative progresses into 2025, Group Audit will evolve to include sharing common work areas with other engagements and firms as well as adapting this feature to unique statutory standards or requirements.</p>
        <p>This initiative will improve the efficiency and quality of group audit engagements, reducing both manual data entry and inconsistencies. </p>
        <p>To learn more about group audit in Caseware Cloud, refer to <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/File-Preparation/Group-audit-overview.htm">Group audit</a>.</p>
        <h2>Component card improvements in the Materiality form</h2>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a><a href="end-user.htm">#enduser</a><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a><a href="network-author.htm">#networkauthor</a>
        </p>
        <p>Improvements have been made to components cards to readily indicate where component performance materiality for specific circumstances has been documented. In addition, authors can now edit the component cards terminology</p>
        <p><b>Component performance materiality for specific circumstances indicator:</b> A new indicator icon will show if there is a specific performance materiality documented for a component. This helps users quickly identify components with performance materiality for specific circumstances without expanding each card.</p>
        <p><b>Editable terminology</b>: Authors can now modify the labels and descriptions within the component cards directly in the Materiality form. This allows customization according to different audit methodologies.</p>

        <p>Cloud Connector will ignore documents inside the engagement files that are hidden. To show documents hidden in the documents page, users can check the filter <b>Show hidden</b> to see all of hidden documents. These hidden documents can be inserted as links into the Excel spreadsheet. In addition, Cloud Connector will update changes to the visibility or identifier IDs of documents within the user’s engagement. The user will need to refresh or reopen Excel to update the links.</p>
        <p class="note in line"><b>Note:</b> This feature does not include linking to external documents such as an Excel, PDF or Word file.</p>

        <p><a href="end-user.htm">#enduser</a>
        </p>
        <p><b>Consistency in visual elements:</b> UI elements have been reviewed for consistency across the <b>Documents</b>,<b> Data</b> and <b>Risks &amp; controls</b> pages by standardizing icons, buttons and terminology. This includes ensuring annotation buttons are uniformly blue and updating tooltips for clarity.</p>
        <h2>Revert changes to default template for text sections or dynamic tables in financial statements</h2>
        <p><a href="end-user.htm">#enduser</a>
        </p>
        <p>Users can now revert the content of dynamic tables or text sections to their original state as they were when the engagement file was created. This new option is available in the More actions [<img src="../Resources/Images/More action icon.png" alt="An icon for More Actions illustrated as three dots in a line." style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />]menu , making it easier for users to restore the initial content if needed.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="note in line"><b>Note:</b> The <b>Sync trial balance</b> option is enabled by default in all products, to disable it see <a href="List-of-product-features-(API).htm#Sync">Sync trial balance</a>. To enable the ability to share a trial balance across different financial groups between products, a mapping file is required. To learn more, see <a href="Set-up-mapping-between-financial-group-structures-synced-TB-across-products.htm">Set up mapping between financial group structures for synced trial balance across products.</a></p>
        <p>This feature enables users to benefit from the efficiencies available with the shared trial balance feature, even when there are differences in financial grouping structures across apps. With this feature, firms can share the same trial balance across multiple engagements in different Caseware Cloud apps. This feature is particularly useful for serving the same client in various engagements, such as auditing and financial reporting.</p>
        <p>This has been developed specifically for use where a mapping relationship exists between the different apps. Firms will now benefit from the efficiency of being able to import one trial balance file, assign accounts once, and can then use that trial balance data across different Cloud apps without having to reimport trial balance accounts.
