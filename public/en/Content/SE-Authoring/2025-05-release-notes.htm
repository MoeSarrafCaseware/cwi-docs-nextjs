        </p>
        <p>Users can now perform a risk assessment on an individual risk. This includes the same level of assessment that users would apply to the assessment of risk for the entire engagement. The individual assessment returns values beside all the tracking metrics.</p>
        <p>This feature supports the user when a greater level of documentation is required to meet the user’s company or industry standards. This feature provides a place to record individual risk assessment levels.</p>
        <p>As a primaryor enterprise author, you will need to enable this feature from the Product settings.</p>
        <p>This feature is available only to new engagements.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The next two feature enhancements are part of a larger initiative to expand multilingual support in Caseware apps.</p>
        <p>These enhancements are available only to new engagements.</p>
        <h3>Multilingual capabilities for Materiality document</h3>
        <p>As a firm, enterprise or primary author, you now have multilingual capabilities in editable fields in the Materiality form. You can select a default language for your engagements and have the additional flexibility to change the language within editable fields.</p>
        <p>Editable fields that include multilingual capabilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Document and Sections Guidance</p>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Tables Headings</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Overall Materiality - Benchmarks Input fields in Tables (Custom formulas / Other)</p>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Multilingual capabilities for Summary of misstatements</h3>
        <p>Similar to the Materiality form, authors can now access multilingual capabilities in the Summary of misstatements document, specifically the Guidance and Key Data (input) fields.</p>

        <h2>Add selected financial groups, areas and cycles to account tables within the Analysis tab</h2>
        <p><a href="end-user.htm">#enduser</a>

            </li>
            <li>

        <h2>Allow end users to assign cycles to financial groups</h2>
        <p><a href="end-user.htm">#enduser</a>
        </p>
        <p>Users can now assign cycles to financial groups from the Data page in their engagements. The ability to assign and see the cycle of a financial group allows users to address why certain groups are showing up in different lead sheets.</p>
        <p>This feature is available for new and existing engagements.</p>
        <p>To learn more about this feature, refer to <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Accounts-and-Analysis/Assign-financial-groups-to-areas.htm">Assign financial groups to areas and cycles</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="end-user.htm">#enduser</a>
        </p>
        <p>Users will notice several improvements to the carry forward feature for financial statements. Carry forward is a time-saving utility that allows you to reuse information from a prior year engagement in a current year engagement. Settings, such as currency symbol types, can be carried forward either in bulk or your users can select which changes to carry forward into the current engagement.</p>
        <p>This feature is available for new and existing engagements.</p>
        <p>All options in the following <b>Document Settings</b> can now be carried forward:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Currency symbol</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Formatting</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Numbered heading</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note in line"><b>Note:</b> Each Area has the ability to override the <b>Document Settings</b> for the <b>Area specific numbered heading options</b>. Area setting changes do not carry forward. </p>
