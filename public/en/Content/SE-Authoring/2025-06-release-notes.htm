            </p>
            <p>Users can now select and subtotal multiple balances from the balance source in a financial group’s property settings. This feature is useful for creating new groups from existing subgroups and increasing the flexibility in how users view financial data.</p>
            <p>This is available for new engagements. The feature is enabled automatically once primary authors update their templates.</p>

        <h2>Automatically carry forward Dynamic Table Border settings</h2>
        <p><a href="end-user.htm">#enduser</a>
        </p>
        <p>Your users can now automatically carry forward <b>Dynamic Table Border</b> settings. Carry forward is a time-saving utility that allows you to reuse information from a prior year engagement in a current year engagement. Settings, such as currency symbol types, can be carried forward either in bulk or your users can select which changes to carry forward into the current engagement.</p>
        <p>The <b>Dynamic Table Border</b> settings that carry forward include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Header Rows</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Total Rows</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Final Rows</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Description Column</p>

            <img src="../Resources/Images/Carryforward-dynamic-table-borders-settings.png" alt="The user interface for selecting dynamic table borders settings" />
        </p>
        <p>These settings will be carried forward automatically. The user will not need to accept the changes.</p>
        <p>This feature is available for new and existing engagements.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> The user can override the <b>Document Settings</b> for the <b>Area specific numbered heading options</b>. Area setting changes do not carry forward.</p>
        <p>To learn more about carry forward, refer to <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/File-Preparation/Carry-forward-an-engagement.htm">Carry forward an engagement</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="note in line"><b>Note:</b>  This feature must be enabled in your <b>Product</b> settings.</p>
        <p>Users can now copy risks and controls from an engagement, or a component within a group audit, into other engagements within your Caseware application. Enabling this feature will add an icon <b>Copy from external engagement item</b> [<img src="../Resources/Images/Icon-Copy-from-external-engagement-item.png" style="vertical-align: bottom;" />] at the top-right corner of your Caseware applications that will allow users to copy data from another engagement into the current engagement. This feature supports consistency and reduces manual effort when preparing a group audit or an engagement.</p>
        <p>This feature is available only in new engagements.</p>
        <p>After selecting the icon for <b>Copy from external engagement item</b>, a dialog box will open that will allow the user to select the engagement that contains the desired copy. From here, users can</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Copy risks and controls from more than one engagement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy risks and controls from engagements within the same entity</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy risks and controls from engagements from all entities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy risks and controls from engagements from all your Caseware applications</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy risks and controls from a component within an engagement.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the user confirms a selected engagement, another dialog box will open to allow the user to copy from that engagement’s <b>Risks</b> and <b>Controls</b>. Relationships between items will also be copied over. For example, from within the source engagement, if <b>Risk 1</b> has a relationship with a <b>Control 2</b> that will copy over into the current engagement. The user of the current engagement can adjust the data and relationships as needed.</p>
        <p>Notes about this feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Copying risks and controls will not link the source and destination of the data; both can be edited independently.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copying will not override disabled features set within the destination engagement.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Checklists copied across engagements as PDFs</h3>
        <p>In addition to copying <b>Risks</b> and <b>Controls</b> from one engagement to another, users can now copy checklists, as PDFs, in a similar fashion. Checklists that are copied across other engagements are converted into PDFs and can be used as references for populating documents within a current engagement.</p>
        <p class="note inline">This feature is available only in new engagements.</p>
        <p>To learn more, refer to <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Planning/Copy-content-from-other-engagements.htm">Copy risks, controls or checklists from other engagements</a>.</p>
        <h2>Final rounded balances for Current Year and Prior Year</h2>
        <p><a href="end-user.htm">#enduser</a>
        </p>
        <p class="note in line"><b>Note:</b>  This feature must be enabled in your <b>Product</b> settings.</p>
        <p>Your users can now see the <b>Current Year</b>’s final rounded balance and the <b>Prior Year</b>’s final rounded balance as two new columns in the <b>Accounts</b> table under the <b>Data</b> page. These numbers will match what is shown in the <b>Financial Statement</b>. This feature ensures alignment between your data and financial statements.</p>
        <p>The rounding conditions (for example, round by thousands vs millions) can be set from the <b>Engagement Settings</b> within the <b>Financial Statements.</b></p>
        <p>This feature is available only in new engagements.</p>
