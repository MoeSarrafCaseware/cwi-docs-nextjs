        <h1>Add Author IDs (new design)</h1>
        <p>Working Papers users can automatically pull files from query documents and save them in designated locations in the Working Papers file. To support this integration, you need to add internal identifiers in your query document - known as Author IDs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Here is a brief overview of the workflow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Set an Author ID value in your query document. You can set it for one or more responses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Working Papers authors apply the same ID to the document that will be replaced with the query document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once a file is uploaded and accepted in the  query document, Working Papers users can pull the file to its designated location in the Document Manager.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note inline">
            <p><b>Notes:</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>You can only add Author IDs if you are customizing the firm template. To access the firm template, you must have the <i>Settings Admin</i> role or similar. See <a href="../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Manage-the-firm-template.htm">Manage the firm template</a> for information on how to open and edit the firm template.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Working Papers authors must first <a href="../Explore/Hybrid-Cloud/Integrate-Working-Papers-with-Queries.htm">integrate Working Papers with&#160;your firm's Queries app</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You must share the Author IDs with the Working Papers authors and decide where to add them in the Working Papers template. If Author IDs are not assigned to a specific location, they will be added in bulk to the top of Document Manager and automatically numbered when received.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
