        <h1>Customize the trial balance groups display settings</h1>
        <p> To view secondary trial balance grouping structures in your product, select the <b>Information</b> icon (<img src="../Resources/Icons/information-icon1.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) at the top menu, then choose <b>Settings</b> to open the Product Settings dialog. Go to the <b>Trial Balance</b> | <b>Groups</b> tab and list the secondary trial balance grouping structures by name. Note that secondary trial balance grouping structures will only be visible if enabled (see <a href="List-of-product-features-(API).htm">Trial Balance</a>).</p>
        <p>If you want group numbers to appear  with the description in the trial balance, select the <b>Show group numbers for financials</b> check box. This is useful for markets that don't have a standard chart of accounts and want to simplify the trial balance by not displaying group numbers.</p>
        <p>This setting also shows group numbers in the Caseware Cloud Connector Add-in (see image below). To learn more, see <a href="How-to-get-started-with-Cloud-Connector.htm">How to get started with Cloud Connector.</a></p>
