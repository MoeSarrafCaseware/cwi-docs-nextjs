        <h1>Define groupings</h1>
        <p>Groupings provide context to the accounts that users import into the product. You need to define groupings to set a structure for trial balance accounts.</p>
        <p>The balances in the financial statements document are organized and displayed based on the groupings you defined. If your users can import a trial balance into the product then you must define a grouping structure.</p>
        <p>The following grouping structures are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Financial grouping</b> - Resembles the layout of the Balance Sheet and Income statement. You can add up to three different financial grouping structures to a product. It supports:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>generating the financial statements and notes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>performing Risk Assessment in the RMM report.</p>
                        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Only the default financial grouping structure can be used to perform risk assessment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>providing the appropriate level of detail for analysis graphs, materiality benchmarks, <a href="Visibility-conditions.htm"><span>visibility conditions</span></a> and leadsheets.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Tax grouping</b> -  Resembles the tax codes applicable for your market. Automapping between the Financial grouping and corresponding tax code is available.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Chart of Accounts</b> - Certain markets may employ a standard chart of accounts that doesn't necessarily resemble the line items in the financial statements.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before you add groupings, you must enable them in the <a href="Enable-tax-and-prescribed-accounts-groupings.htm">product settings</a>. You can then manually add groupings or you can import them from an Excel file or a CSV file, or from Working Papers.</p>
