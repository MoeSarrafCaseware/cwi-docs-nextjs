        <h1>Manage analytics tests in the Analytics Hub</h1>
        <p>The Analytics Hub is a central location that you can use to view a list of all analytic tests that have been linked to a checklist in your product. When you select a test, you can view configuration details as well as a list of checklist procedures linked to the test. You have the option of duplicating an analytic test to customize it. See Customize an analytic test for more information. </p>

        <p>You can also select <b>Remove all procedure linkages</b> to remove links to checklist procedures for a test. Note that if you select this option, the test will no longer display in the Analytics Hub.</p>
