        <h1>Recommendations for multilingual implementation</h1>
        <p>Here are the implementation recommendations for multilingual capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>To set up translated versions for note disclosures: Create multiple versions of the notes in different languages with visibility settings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To set up translated versions for letters: Create multiple versions of the letter sections in different languages with visibility settings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To set up translated query questions and checklist procedures: Create multiple versions of the procedures and query questions in different languages using dynamic text.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For detailed instructions, see <a href="Use--case---A-product-with-French-and-English-language-support.htm">Use- case: A template with French and English language support</a>.</p>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Multilingual capabilities feature does not automatically translate content. You must provide the translations for the languages that you want your SE product to support.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you delete a language, the translated text that you have added in the template is not deleted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On carry forward, the selected content language is carried over to the next period's file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Firm authors cannot add or delete languages but they can make all other changes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Firm author changes for content language are not overridden when they update the firm template with the latest change from the product template.</p>
            </li>
            <p>However, there is one exception:</p>
            <p> If firm or enterprise authors make a language active in the firm template, then you, as the primary author, change it to inactive in the product template, your settings override what's in the firm or enterprise template once firm or enterprise authors <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Manage-the-firm-template.htm#Updatethefirmtemplate">update</a> it - and the language becomes inactive.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Add or modify available languages for an engagement</h2>
        <p>As a primary author, you can set which languages and how many languages are available for documentation within an engagement. As an enterprise or firm author, you select which languages to include based on the available languages set by the primary author.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>From the product template, click the [<img src="../Resources/Images/info icon black.png" />] Information button at the top of the screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <b>Settings</b> option to open <b>Product Settings</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <b>Content language</b> under the <b>Format</b> section</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <b>Add Language</b> button to add a new language for selection.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the table below the <b>Add language</b> button, you can select or deselect languages for availability in your engagements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can also set one language as your default language.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <h2>Multilingual capabilities for Materiality form</h2>
        <p>As a firm, enterprise or primary author, you have multilingual capabilities in editable fields in the Materiality form. You can select a default language for your engagements and have the additional flexibility to change the language within editable fields.</p>
