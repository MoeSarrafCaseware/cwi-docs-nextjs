        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">What is multi-language support</h1>
        <p>Multi-language support aims at facilitating SE product offerings in regions and markets where there is a requirement to present deliverables and content in multiple languages.</p>
        <p>With multi-language support, you can work in one SE app that meets the language requirements of your market, instead of previously, having to create and maintain an app for each language.</p>
        <p>For engagement preparers, multi-language support provides the flexibility of changing the content and deliverables language from within the engagement file. This way, they can efficiently author or make content changes.</p>
