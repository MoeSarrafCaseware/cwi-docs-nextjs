        <h1>Automate time entries based on time in a file</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresTime.flsnp" />
        <p>Whether you are management or staff, it is crucial to submit accurate time entries. One way to ensure accuracy is through <b>Automatic Engagement Tracking</b>, which automatically records the time you spend in a supported engagement file. This can eliminate most clerical errors if you're manually submitting time.</p>
        <p>Automatic engagement tracking works by recording the time you spend in a Working Papers file (or integrated app) and creates pending entries for your approval. Pending entries function like time entries, but must first be assigned a work code and approved before they can be counted as billable or non-billable time.</p>
        <p><b>To generate time entries based on time spent in the file automatically:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure you have <i>Settings Admin</i> role or the equivalent privileges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Settings</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the <b>Time</b> drop-down menu, select <b>Time and Expense Settings</b>.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <b>Automatic Engagement Tracking</b> checkbox, and select <b>Save</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Time spent in integrated apps and files is now recorded in the <b>Time</b> app as a series of pending entries. </p>
