        <h1>Deprecation of Google &amp; SharePoint integration</h1>
        <p>Due to the low usage of Google and SharePoint integration capabilities, we have decided to deprecate this feature. This change enables us to focus our efforts on solutions that provide greater value and long-term benefits to our entire user base. Please see below for more details.</p>
        <h2>What is changing?</h2>
        <p>With the release of Caseware Cloud 40.0, Google and SharePoint integrations will no longer be supported. The following features will be impacted:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Google Drive/SharePoint integration</b> - Allows users to create and manage their files on these platforms directly from Caseware Cloud.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Google Calendar integration</b> - Allows users to sync their calendar events with Caseware Cloud.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Google Viewer</b> - Allows users to preview Microsoft Office documents from a web browser.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="Work-with-Google-Drive-and-SharePoint-files.htm">Work with Google Drive and SharePoint files</a>.</p>
        <h2>What is the timeline?</h2>
        <p>This change will take effect with the release of Caseware Cloud 40.0. Specific dates for each region are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Canada - July 16th</p>
            </li>
            <li>

                <p>United States - July 24th</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

                <p>Access existing integrated files from Caseware Cloud</p>
