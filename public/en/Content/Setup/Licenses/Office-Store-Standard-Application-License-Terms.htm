        <h1>Office Store Standard Application License Terms</h1>
        <p>These license terms are an agreement between App Provider and you. Please read them. They apply to the add-in, connector or other software application you download from the Office Store or acquire from within the settings of an Office product ("App"), unless the App comes with separate terms ("Third-Party License"). If so, the terms of the Third-Party License will apply. This agreement also applies to any updates and supplements for the App, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING THE APP, OR ATTEMPTING TO DO ANY OF THESE, YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT INTEND TO ACCEPT THEM, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO (AND MUST NOT) DOWNLOAD OR USE THE APP.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Except for the above, if the App enables access to any Internet-based services, your use of those services will be subject to the separately-provided terms of use.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">In this agreement "App Provider" means the entity licensing the App to you, as identified in the Office Store or the App's description. If the App is licensed to you by Microsoft, then the App Provider is Microsoft (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates).</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.</b> You may install and use the App on a Windows device or devices that are affiliated with the Microsoft account that you use to access the Office Store or Office product. You may not install or use a copy of the App on a device you do not own or control.</p>

            <li>
                <p><b>INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.</b> The App Provider may provide Internet-based services with the App. In addition to the following, your use of those services is subject to the terms provided to you by the App Provider and/or your wireless carrier.</p>
                <p><b>Consent for Internet-Based or Wireless Services.</b> The App may connect to computer systems over an Internet-based and/or wireless network. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. Using the App operates as your consent to the transmission of standard device information (including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and App software, and peripherals) for Internet-based and/or wireless services.</p>
                <p><b>Misuse of Internet-based Services.</b> You may not use any Internet-based service in any way that could harm it or impair anyone else's use of it or the wireless network. You also may not use any Internet-based service to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account, or network by any means.</p>
