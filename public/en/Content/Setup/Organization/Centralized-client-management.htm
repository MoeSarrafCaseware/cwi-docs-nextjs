        <h1>Centralized client management (early access)</h1>
        <p>The new Entities app is designed to improve administrative efficiency and create a seamless user experience.</p>
        <p>Through centralized client management, Entity Admins can manage client information across multiple business units from a central location. They don't have to navigate between different business units to perform day-to-day client management tasks, such as updating information, sharing access with staff, tagging clients, etc.</p>
        <h2>Seamless navigation</h2>
        <p>Navigating through multiple business units is now made seamless by displaying all entities on one page. See below for details on how you can use the various new capabilities.</p>

                        <p><b>Tabs</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>Each tab represents a specific business unit, and clients within each business unit will be listed in these tabs. The name of each tab indicates the business unit names. Users will see all business units where they have entities assigned to them.</p>

                        <p><b>Count of entities</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>The number within brackets reflects the number of entities to which the user has access. If the user has an Admin role, the 	number will show the total number of entities in the business unit.</p>
                        <p>When users perform a search or use a filter, this number will update to show the number of matching results in each 	business unit.</p>
                    </td>

                        <p><b>Scrolling and Sorting</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>Users can now use the scroll bar to scan the entire list of entities within a business unit. They no longer need to click through different pages.</p>
                        <p>The list of entities in each tab can be sorted by columns.</p>
                    </td>

                        </p>
                        <p>In a firm with many business units, Admins who have access to all of them can use the List menu to quickly access a 	different business unit, without having to scroll through the page.</p>

                        <p><b>Navigation buttons</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>Users can also use the navigation buttons to the top right of the page to navigate between different business units.</p>

                        <p><b>Search</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>The advanced search functionality allows users to search for entities across all business units to which they have access. Search results are displayed in their respective business units and the count of entities would be dynamically updated to show the accurate number of matching results.</p>

                        <p><b>Filters</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>The new filter UI also includes a filter for business units. Users can filter the view to specific business units if needed.</p>
                        <p>The filters have also been enhanced to better suit users' needs.</p>
                        <p>As a result, for fields that can have multiple values (e.g. Tags), users can filter by more than one value and the results will include entities matching any of the selected values.</p>
                        <p>Note that all currently available filters have been retained.</p>
                    </td>

        <h2>Entity actions</h2>
        <p>Actions on entities (Tag, Share, Move, Delete, etc.) can be performed by selecting single or multiple entities. Users can find the appropriate menu for both scenarios as shown in the screenshots below.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Entity imports</h2>
        <p>The new import feature is designed to support business units. Cloud Admins can now import a list of entities across multiple business units with a single import file. The feature allows users to specify a business unit for each entity in the file.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/new-entities-04.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>How can users access the new pages?</h2>
        <p>The early access phase of the new Entities app is only available to Cloud Admins. They can find the new app in the Cloud menu, among other applications. Once the early access phase is complete, this will replace the current Entities app.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Future improvements</h2>
        <p><b>Bulk actions ('Select all' entities option)</b> - We currently support single and multi-select options for entities. In a future release, we will consider including the option to select ALL entities within a business unit and perform actions in bulk. </p>
        <p><b>View management across business units</b> - In the current iteration, any custom views created within a business unit, are available only within that business unit (tab). For example, if a user had created a custom view in BU1, then that view will be available for selection only on that business unit. In a future release, we will provide a more consistent user experience for creating, selecting and working with custom views across business units.</p>
