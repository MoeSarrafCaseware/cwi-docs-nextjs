        <h1>Manage groups across business units</h1>
        <p>The <b>Global Staff Groups</b> app is a centralized location for <i>Admins</i> and <i>Staff Admin</i>s to manage security groups across all business units in their organization.</p>
        <p>The <b>Global Staff Groups</b> app can be used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Create new groups and assign them to one or more business units from a single page. Group members will gain access to these business units.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Assign roles to groups in one or more business units. For more information on the different types of roles (e.g. organization roles and content roles), see <a href="../Security/Built-in-roles.htm">Built-in roles</a>.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add staff to any group across the organization.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <p><b>Note:</b> Previously, each business unit included an <b>All Staff</b> group that contained all staff members from those specific business units. In order to manage all staff members across the organization more efficiently, we’ve made the following changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>A new <b>All Staff</b> group has been added to the “Admin” business unit to fulfill the purpose of the original <b>All Staff</b> group, but at an organization level. This group will include all staff members across the organization (i.e. all business units).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>With the new organization-level <b>All Staff</b> group mentioned above, the existing <b>All Staff</b> groups from each individual business unit no longer serve their intended purposes. As a result, they have been converted to custom groups named after the original business unit and date (e.g. <i>AllStaff-BU1-2024-06-30</i>). These custom groups will retain all their original staff and permission settings, but new staff will no longer be added automatically. You can choose to rename/edit/delete these groups as you see fit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Before deleting the original <b>All Staff</b> group, ensure that all members are given the following access and permissions from the group via another staff group or direct assignments:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>App access</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Content or organization-wide roles</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Business unit assignments</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Staff that are not given these permissions before deletion of the group may lose access to content that they previously had.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
