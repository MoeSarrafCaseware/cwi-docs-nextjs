        <h1>New Contacts app (early access)</h1>
        <p>The new Contacts app is designed with the end user in mind. We've revamped the current version of the app by adding updated technology and improved user experience elements.</p>
        <p>The new app will act as a strong foundation to enable efficient and faster implementation of advanced features as part of upcoming initiatives.</p>
        <h2>New user interface</h2>
        <p>The new Contacts app has a modern look and feel that aligns with our current design approach. Firms currently using the business units feature will notice that the new app is consistent with the Global Staff and Groups apps.</p>
        <p>Besides the look and feel upgrade, the technological upgrade acts as a strong foundation for future initiatives. Front-end changes can now be implemented and deployed much faster, more efficiently and independently from major platform releases, allowing us to respond to customer feedback faster.</p>
        <p>See details on key highlights below:</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>With the new interface, users can now use the scroll bar to view the entire list of contacts. They no longer need to click through different pages. This behavior is more intuitive and eliminates a lot of extra clicks.</p>

                        <p>The Search bar is available at the top of the app. There has been no change in functionality.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The filters have also been enhanced to better suit users' needs.</p>
                        <p>As a result, for fields that can have multiple values (e.g. Tags), users can filter by more than one value and the results will include entities matching any of the selected values.</p>
                        <p>Note that all currently available filters have been retained.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Views menu includes built-in and custom views, as well as the option to export the current view to a CSV file. Admins and Setting Admins can access the Views Management panel in the Firm Settings to modify the views that are available to users.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Select one or multiple entities from the boxes to the left of the entity name. The available options vary depending on how many entities are selected. For example, with one entity selected, the options mirror the More actions menu. With multiple entities selected, users can no longer edit the entity but can assign the entities to contact groups.</p>

                </tr>
            </tbody>

        <h2>How can users access the new page?</h2>
        <p>The early access phase of the new Contacts app is only available to Entity Admins and higher roles. They can find the new app in the Cloud menu, among other applications. Once the early access phase is complete, this will replace the current Contacts app.</p>

        <h2>Future improvements</h2>
        <p><b>Bulk actions ('Select all' contacts option)</b> - We currently support single and multi-select options for contacts. In a future release, we will consider including the option to select ALL contacts within the organization and perform actions in bulk.</p>
