        <h1>Organize internal entities</h1>
        <p>You can use <b>Internal Entities</b> to help organize your organization's files and activities in Cloud. Internal entities can represent departments, activities, or specializations within your business.</p>
        <p>In this example, the administrator has created internal entities by department. The management team has decided that the Administration team would benefit from having its own entity, so the administrator adds another entity.</p>
