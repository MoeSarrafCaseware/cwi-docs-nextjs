        <h1>Assign system-wide security roles</h1>
        <p>You can assign <b>system-wide</b> roles to users or groups. These roles grant users the ability to view or modify specific types of content across your entire Cloud site. For example, the <i>Viewer</i> role grants users the ability to view files and activities contained in entities and leave comments, while the <i>Entity Access</i> role only lets users view information about the entity itself, such as when the entity was added or its organizational structure.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can assign <b>entity-specific</b>, <b>file-specific</b> or <b>activity-specific</b> roles. You may want to assign a combination of these roles to a user or group. For example, assume that you want certain staff to be able to view all client entities (and any activities or files associated with entities) but only edit a specific set of entities that they have specific duties on. You can do this by assigning the appropriate system-wide and entity roles to these employees.</p>

                    <p>System-wide roles determine the level of access that you want to grant to staff or staff groups. Refer to<a href="Built-in-roles.htm"> Built-in roles</a> to view a description of each role.</p>

Organization-wide roles grant users the role's privileges across all business units, where system-wide roles only grant the role's privileges to a specific business unit.
