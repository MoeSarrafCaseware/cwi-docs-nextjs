        <h1>Create staff or contact groups</h1>
        <p>User groups are a key aspect of organizing users in Cloud. Having users assigned to either <b>contact groups</b> or <b>staff groups</b> enables you to change multiple users' properties simultaneously. These properties include what apps users can access, and what security access roles users will have on content they are assigned.</p>
        <p>For example, you may want to create staff groups for your organization based on seniority.</p>
        <h2 id="Creating-a-new-group">Create a new group</h2>
        <p>You can create both Staff and Contact groups from the <b>Groups</b> page.</p>
        <p><b>To create a new group:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Staff Admin</i> role or equivalent privileges.</p>
            </li>
