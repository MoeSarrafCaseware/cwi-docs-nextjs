        <h1>Review the security settings for the All Staff group</h1>
        <p>When you add a new staff in Cloud, they are automatically assigned to the <b>All Staff</b> group. The security settings for this group determines the base level of access that new staff get.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The <b>All Contacts</b> group has been deprecated. The existing group has been converted to a custom group with all its original members and permission settings. New contacts will no longer automatically join the group; however, you can now repurpose, modify or delete the group if required.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To review the security settings for the All Staff group:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Staff Admin</i> role or equivalent privileges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Groups</b>. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <b>All Staff</b> group. The details pane is displayed on the right.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Review any system-wide roles that your firm has assigned to this group and any entities that the group already has access to. You can make changes to the assigned security roles. To learn more about security roles, see <a href="../Security/Built-in-roles.htm">Built-in roles</a>.</p>

        <p class="bestpractice inline"><b>Best Practice:</b> For large size firms, we recommend you remove all security roles assigned to the All Staff group to ensure <a href="Create-staff-or-contact-groups.htm">custom</a> staff  groups function properly.</p>
