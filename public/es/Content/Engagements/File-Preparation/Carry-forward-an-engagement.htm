You can accept all of last year’s changes or you can accept some and work only on the individual items that have changed in the current year.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/SE-what-is-carried-forward.flsnp" /><p>You can&apos;t carry forward changes in your <a href="../Template-and-Authoring/Manage-the-firm-template.htm#Concepts">product template</a>.
