        <h1>Compartir un archivo de Caseware SmartSync en Caseware Cloud</h1><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresWorkingPapers.flsnp" /><p>Once you have reviewed the prior year&apos;s file, created your engagement team, and set your milestones and deadlines, you should be ready to share the new engagement file with your team. You can use Cloud as a SmartSync environment, setting up a parent copy in the client workspace. Your team members can then create synchronized copies of this parent file.</p>

        <p>You have created a new Working Papers file for this client engagement, and now you want to make the file accessible to the other members of your engagement team. To do this, you will need to publish the local file, creating a primary copy on Cloud.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To-publish-a-Working-Papers-file.flsnp" /><p>You have successfully published your Working Papers file to Cloud. This creates a primary copy of the file on Cloud, and you can now share it with other staff members.</p>
        <h2 id="Creating-a-sync-copy"><a name="Creating2"></a>Creating a sync (child) copy</h2>
        <p>If the file for your upcoming engagement has been published by somebody else, you will need to have a copy of the file to work on. You can do this by opening a sync copy from Cloud.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To create a sync copy:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Editor</i> role or equivalent rights for the Working Papers file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Working Papers</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the Working Papers file you will be working on.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/open-sync-copy-1-630x229.png" style="border:1px solid #3f66a3" alt="Select a Working Papers file. The details pane is displayed on the right." /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the details pane, select the <b>More Actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Ellipsis-20x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) <b>| Open Sync Copy</b>.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/open-sync-copy-2-630x422.png" style="border:1px solid #3f66a3" alt="Select the Open Sync Copy command." /></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You now have a sync copy of the parent file open in Working Papers, and you will be ready to begin allocating work or assigning work on the file yourself when the engagement begins.</p>
