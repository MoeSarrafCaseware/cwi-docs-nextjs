        <h1>Configurar la biblioteca de notas</h1>
        <p>The Notes Library provides a pool of notes that allows engagement team members to easily find and add notes in the financial statements document. Notes are automatically organized in the library by categories. Categories are the available note titles in the document.</p>
        <p>The library also features a search field, where users can enter a keyword to filter notes.</p>
        <p class="bestpractice"><b>Best Practice:</b> We recommend that firm authors set up the Notes library in the firm template. Firm authors are staff members with the <b>Settings Admin</b> role or similar. See <a href="Manage-the-firm-template.htm">Manage the firm template</a> for more information. See also <a href="../../Setup/Security/Built-in-roles.htm">Built-in roles</a> and <a href="../../Setup/Security/Assign-system-wide-security-roles.htm">Assign security roles</a> for information on roles.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The following steps describe how to set up the Notes library.</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Create notes</h3><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/se-to-create-notes-and-note-headings.flsnp" /><h3>Step 2: Define note associations <i>(Optional)</i></h3>
        <p>An association refers to the trial balance groups that a specific note is related to. Use associations to further categorize notes by associating them with specific trial balance groups.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To associate a note to a trial balance group:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select the note that you want to associate with a trial balance group.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>More actions (<img src="../../Resources/Images/more-actions-inline.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) | Associations.</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Add Financial Groups (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/financial-stat-add1.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />)</b> to populate the trial balance data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose a trial balance group to associate the note with.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Seleccione <b>Guardar</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 3: Exclude notes</h3>
        <p>When a note is excluded from the document, it is stored in the Notes Library. The Notes Library is only available if there are excluded notes in the document. To populate the Notes Library with the notes you&apos;ve created in Step 1, you need to exclude them.</p>
        <p><b>To automatically exclude notes,</b> <a href="What-are-visibility-settings.htm#Add4">set up visibility conditions</a> for each note. Once the conditions evaluate to <i>false</i> (conditions are not met), the note is automatically excluded from the document and stored in the Notes Library.</p>
        <p>If you don&apos;t want to set up visibility conditions, you can manually exclude the notes.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To manually exclude a note:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Go to the note that you want to exclude.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>More actions (<img src="../../Resources/Images/more-actions-inline.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) | Exclude.</b></p>
            </li>
            <p>The note is excluded from the document and stored in the Notes Library.</p>
        </ol>
