        <h1>Agregar Id. de autor</h1>
        <p>Working Papers (WP) users can automatically pull files uploaded in query documents and save them in designated folder locations in the WP file.</p>
        <p>To support this integration, you need to add internal identifiers in your query document - known as Author IDs.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> You can only add an author ID if you are customizing the firm template. To access the firm template, you must have the Settings Admin role or similar. See <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Manage-the-firm-template.htm">Manage the firm template</a> for more information.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/se-set-up-the-author-id.flsnp" /></body>
