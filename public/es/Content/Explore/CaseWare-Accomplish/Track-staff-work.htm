        <h1>Seguimiento del trabajo del personal</h1>
        <p>Caseware Accomplish has four different views you can use to track staff work.</p>
        <p>Note that Caseware Accomplish displays jobs for the entity you are currently working in. You can use the entity selector at the top of the page to select a specific entity or to view work for all entities.</p>
        <p>Before you start, select <b>Accomplish</b> from the <b>Cloud</b> menu to open the app.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> You must create a workflow for Working Papers files in order to track and change their status in Caseware Accomplish. Para más información, consulte <a href="../../Setup/Administration-and-Settings/Create-custom-fields-tags-and-workflows.htm#Creating2">Añadir zonas</a>.</p>
        <h2>Vista general</h2>
        <p>The <b>Overview</b> view allows you to view at a glance any <a href="View-and-manage-job-details.htm#Set">reminders</a> you have set, queries that clients have responded to, and statistics for both jobs assigned to you and jobs associated with the entity you are viewing.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Accomplish - Overview.png" alt="The Overview view." /></p>
        <h2><a name="Status"></a>Status view</h2>
        <p>The <b>Status</b> view displays jobs based on whether they are unassigned, open, or stuck. Open jobs are jobs that are assigned to a staff member but not yet complete. You can drag a job from the <b>Unassigned</b> column to the <b>Open</b> column to assign it to yourself.</p>
        <p>Stuck jobs are jobs that are in a stage that is considered to be &quot;waiting&quot; or &quot;blocked&quot;. For example, queries that clients have not yet responded to are considered to be stuck. Engagements with workflow stages that contain the terms &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;block&quot; or &quot;ready&quot;, or their French equivalents, are also considered to be stuck. You cannot manually move jobs to the <b>Stuck</b> column.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Engagement workflow stages are displayed in either French or English depending on the language the engagement is set to use.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Status English.png" alt="The Status view." /></p>
        <p>If you have selected to include completed jobs in the <a href="#Filter">filters pane</a>, a fourth column to display completed jobs is also displayed in this view. Jobs are automatically moved to this column when they reach their last workflow stage. You can also manually drag jobs to this column to mark them as complete.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Accomplish - Status Filter.png" alt="The Complete column on the Status view page." /></p>
        <h2>Due Date view</h2>
        <p>The <b>Due Date</b> view displays jobs in columns based on their due date. You can drag and drop jobs to a different column to change the due date.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Due Date - English.png" alt="The Due Date view." /></p>
        <p>Once you drag a job to a new column, the Set Due Date dialog displays. You can use the calendar to specify the new date.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Accomplish - Set Due Date.png" alt="Relevant dates display in the Due Date calendar." /></p>
        <p>Jobs without a due date are displayed in the <b>No Due Date</b> column. We recommend setting <a href="Assign-or-reassign-work.htm#Set">due dates</a> for all jobs to ensure you can make optimal use of the <b>Due Date</b> view.</p>
        <h2>People view</h2>
        <p>The <b>People</b> view displays jobs based on the assignee. This allows you to easily ensure work is distributed evenly amongst your staff members. You can drag and drop jobs to different columns to assign the job to a different staff member.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/people view - English.png" alt="The People view." /></p>
        <h2><a name="Filter"></a>Filter jobs</h2>
        <p>You can use filters to customize the jobs you see in Caseware Accomplish. The filters you select will apply to all views in Accomplish and are preserved when you close Accomplish until you clear them. You can use the <b>Clear</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/accomplish-clear-filter.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) icon in the filter pane to clear your filters.</p>
