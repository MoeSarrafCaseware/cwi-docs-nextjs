        <h1>Archive and lock down the engagement</h1>
        <p>Once all work on the engagement is complete, you can download a reference copy of the engagement to send to your client or for your own records. The reference copy is a .zip file containing PDF copies of all the documents in your engagement.</p>
        <p>To download a reference copy, select <b>Information (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/InformationIcon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) | Download reference copy</b>.</p>
        <p>Based on your organization’s lockdown policy and the type of engagement you’re performing, you may also need to lock down the file by a certain date. Select the Entity name to open the Engagement Properties popup, then select <b>Lockdown</b>.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/docuflex-can-02.png" alt="The Lockdown button in the Engagement properties popup." /></p>
        <p>Note that you will not need to lock down the engagement until the engagement has been signed off on, and key deliverables are provided to your client.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, your organization may have opted to enable system driven automatic lockdown.</p>
        <p>Once the file is locked:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>Locked</b> status is visible below the Entity name. The <b>Lockdown Information</b> button displays in the Engagement Properties popup. This button opens an activity log for lock and unlock events.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can no longer make any changes in the engagement. You only have view rights.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All other staff members with access to the engagement can no longer make any changes to the file and only have view rights.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
