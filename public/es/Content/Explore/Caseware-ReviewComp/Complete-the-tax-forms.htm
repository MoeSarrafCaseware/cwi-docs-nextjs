        <h1>Complete the tax forms</h1><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresRCT.flsnp" /> <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Tax-deprecation-note.flsnp" /><p>With your client&apos;s data now populating your ReviewComp engagement forms, you can begin the tax engagement work. Start by completing the Tax Preparer Profile document, which requires you to enter detailed information about your firm. Some fields will be automatically filled if your firm has completed its Cloud firm profile.</p>
        <p>Because you completed the Tax Optimiser document, ReviewComp will only list the documents that are relevant to your tax engagement. To see all forms available in ReviewComp, select <b>More Actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Ellipsis-20x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) | <b>Hidden Items</b>, or open the <b>Tax Forms List</b> document.</p>
        <p>Your Optimiser selections determine which worksheets, if any, are added to the <b>Documents</b> list. Worksheets are documents designed to streamline your engagement work.</p>
        <h2>Navigate between documents</h2>
        <p>Caseware ReviewComp makes it easy to navigate between worksheets and their related schedules as you complete the return.</p>
        <p>When you select a field that has a single source, the Field Override dialog opens. When you select <b>Jump to Source</b>, the source document opens and jumps directly to the appropriate line, with the source field highlighted.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/jump-to-source.PNG" alt="Field Ovveride dialog." /></p>
        <p>In documents where an entire row of data is derived from one specific source document, you&apos;ll find the <b>Viewer</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-visibility-visible.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) to the right of the row. The Viewer opens the linked document in a pop-up display without opening a new browser window or tab. For example, each class listed in the <b>S8 - Capital Class Allocation</b> document is linked to its corresponding page from the CCA Worksheet.</p>
        <h2><a name="Search"></a>Search tax forms and worksheets</h2>
        <p>The <b>Search</b> button in tax forms and worksheets launches the Search Tax Forms dialog which allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Search visible or hidden tax forms and worksheets on the <b>Documents</b> page of the engagement.</p>
