        <h1>Start the tax engagement</h1><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresRCT.flsnp" /> <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Tax-deprecation-note.flsnp" /><p>To get started, create a new Caseware ReviewComp engagement file. When you create your new engagement, you can also set key dates and budgets and assign staff members to the file to prepare and review the engagement work.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Create-RC-engagement.flsnp" /><h2>Set the workflow status, reporting period and year end date</h2>
        <p>When you first open the engagement, a pop-up appears in the top-left displaying the engagement&apos;s <b>Workflow</b> status. The Workflow status lets clients and other stakeholders know how far along in the engagement process you are. If you intend to start working on the engagement right away, set the Workflow status to <b>In Progress</b>.</p>
        <p>Select the desired <b>Reporting period</b>.</p>
        <p>With the pop-up still open, set the engagement&apos;s <b>Year end date</b>. Note that an incorrect year-end date will affect trial balance imports.</p>
        <p>Seleccione <b>Guardar</b>. You will now see the engagement&apos;s <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
        <h2>Set the engagement type to Tax</h2>
        <p>To enable ReviewComp&apos;s tax features, you need to complete the procedures in the <b>0-10 Planning Optimiser</b> checklist. The first question in the checklist prompts you to specify the type of your engagement. If you only want to perform a corporate tax return, select <b>Corporation Tax only</b> as the type of engagement being performed. If you want to perform a review or compilation engagement along with the tax return, select <b>Review and Corporation Tax</b> or <b>Compilation and Corporation Tax</b> as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Complete the rest of the checklist as appropriate.</p>
