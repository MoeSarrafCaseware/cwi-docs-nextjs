        <ul>
            <li>Analyses are customizable templates for visualizations. You can share an analysis with other Sherlock Builder users to collaborate on its development.</li>
            <li>Visualizations are the read-only versions of analyses that Sherlock Reader users share with clients.</li>
            <li>Datasets contain the collective data that populates an analysis. The datasets in Sherlock Builder are preloaded and cannot be modified. Datasets refresh daily.</li>
