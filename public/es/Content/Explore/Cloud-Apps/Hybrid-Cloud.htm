        <h1>¿Qué es Caseware Hybrid Cloud?</h1>
        <p>Caseware Hybrid Cloud is what we call the integration of Caseware Cloud products with Caseware Working Papers. In this &apos;hybrid&apos; environment, your organization can benefit from the familiarity of Working Papers, while including the advancements and accessibility that Cloud brings. Setting up a Hybrid Cloud environment will help your organization with the eventual transition to a purely Cloud-based solution.</p>
        <p><a href="../Hybrid-Cloud/Integrate-Working-Papers-with-Cloud.htm">Integrating Working Papers with Cloud</a> expands the functionality of Working Papers to include Cloud specific features and apps. This integrated environment allows you to easily store and manage your engagement files, improve collaboration between staff and clients and track the progress of your engagement from Working Papers by utilizing Cloud functionality.</p><div class="note inline"><p><b>Notas:</b></p>
