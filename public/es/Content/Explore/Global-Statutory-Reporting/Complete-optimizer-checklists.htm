        <h1>Completar listas de control del optimizador</h1>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The checklists available may vary depending on your product, but there are commonly used checklists across many Global Statutory Reporting products.</p>
        <p>In the engagement file, you can access the optimizer checklists in the <b>Documents</b> page under the <b>Settings</b> section. These checklists allow you to tailor your financial statements to meet specific entity requirements and standards.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Ensure you complete all the optimizer checklists before you import data or begin preparing the financial statements. This ensures import documents and information display correctly in your engagement. In addition to the checklists described below, you may need to complete additional checklists depending on your region.</p>
        <h2>Configuración del encargo</h2>
        <p>The <b>Engagement settings</b> optimizer provides you with a structured checklist to customize and define global settings for your financial reporting needs.</p>
        <p>For each procedure, make a selection that best fits the entity&apos;s characteristics and reporting requirements. This ensures that the financial statements generated are tailored to the specific nature and needs of the entity. The following table provides guidance on each procedure in the checklist.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Not all procedures described in the table are available in every product. The procedures available for this checklist in your product depend on your region.</p>

        <h2>Statements and note visibility</h2>
        <p>The <b>Statements and notes visibility</b> optimizer(s) allow you to manage the visibility of notes within the financial statements. This allows you to tailor the disclosure of general information, accounting principles and other notes that are not directly tied to the financial amounts presented. It also gives you flexibility in customizing how financial information is documented and shared, ensuring that the financial statements accurately reflect the organization&apos;s reporting requirements and preferences.</p>
        <p>You can also customize your financial statements to meet specific needs and adhere to regional regulatory standards. For example, you can choose to classify expenses by either function or nature, determine whether to present a combined or separate Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, make decisions regarding the presentation method for the Statement of Cash Flows (Direct or Indirect) and utilize the Cashflow import tool.</p>
