        <h1>Firm settings - Engagement File Management</h1>
        <h2><a name="Prior"></a>Prior Engagement Rules</h2>
        <p>This setting lets you specify when to label engagements as ‘Prior engagements’ after a defined period elapses past the year-end date. ‘Prior engagements’ are automatically hidden from the file list in your engagement apps, accelerating page load times and file searches.</p>
        <p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/prior-engagements-setting.png" alt="The Prior Engagement Rules page in the firm settings." /></p>
        <p>Once enabled, staff will only see the list of active engagements, but they can easily switch between active and prior using the <b>Prior engagements</b> toggle at the top of the file list.</p>

        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This function does not affect the <b>File | Open | Caseware Cloud</b> menu in Working Papers. Prior engagements will remain visible.</p>
