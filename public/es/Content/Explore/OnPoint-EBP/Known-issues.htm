        <h2>AU-C reference hyperlinks</h2>
        <p>Due to a restructuring of the AICPA website, certain hyperlinks to the PDF versions of the auditing standards (i.e., AU-Cs) may not presently work. The affected hyperlinks will be automatically redirected to the appropriate location soon. In the meantime, you may download the full text of all of the AU-C sections that are currently effective by navigating to <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/aicpa-statements-on-auditing-standards-currently-effective">https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/aicpa-statements-on-auditing-standards-currently-effective</a>.</p>
