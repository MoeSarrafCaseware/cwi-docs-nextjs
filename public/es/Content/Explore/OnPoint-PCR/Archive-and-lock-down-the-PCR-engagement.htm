        <h1>Archive and lock down the engagement</h1><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/TopicRequiresPCR.flsnp" /><p>Once all work on the engagement is complete, you can download a reference copy of the engagement to send to the client or for your own records. The reference copy is a .zip file containing PDF copies of all the documents in your engagement.</p>
        <p>To download a reference copy, select <b>Information</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-information-menu-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) | <b>Download reference copy</b>.</p>
        <p>You can also lockdown the file. Select the title to open the <b>Engagement Properties</b> dialog, then select <b>Lockdown</b>.</p>
        <p>Note that you will not need to lockdown the engagement until the engagement has been signed off on, and key deliverables are provided to the end users.</p>
        <p><b>Once you lock the file:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>Lock</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-lock.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) displays next to the title. The (<b>Lockdown Information</b>) button displays in the <b>Engagement Properties</b> dialog. This button opens a dialog that shows an activity log for lock and unlock events.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can no longer make any changes in the engagement. You only have view rights.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All other staff members with access to the engagement can no longer make any changes in the file and only have view rights.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Staff members can unlock a locked file at any point in time - provided that they have access to the engagement. For example, to make a few changes based on last minute updates from the client. To unlock the file, select the title to open the Engagement Properties dialog and select <b>Unlock</b>.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/in-progress-pcr.png" alt="Unlock the file. " /></p>
        <p>You can also select <b>Lockdown Information</b> to display a dialog showing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The date of any lock or unlock action.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The user initiating the lock or unlock action.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The reason for any unlock action.</p>
            </li>
