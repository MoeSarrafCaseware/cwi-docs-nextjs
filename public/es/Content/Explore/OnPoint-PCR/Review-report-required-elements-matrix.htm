This investment is therefore accounted for on a cost basis by the Company. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the subsidiary should have been consolidated because it is controlled by the Company.

            <h2>Change in engagement from audit to review</h2>
        </p>
        <p><b>.132</b> If the accountant, who was engaged to perform an audit engagement in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, has been requested to change the engagement to a review engagement, the accountant should consider the following before deciding whether to agree to the change (Ref: par. .A204–.A205):</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p>The reason given for the request, particularly the implications of a restriction on the scope of the audit engagement, whether imposed by management or by circumstances (Ref: par. .A206).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The additional audit effort required to complete the audit engagement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The estimated additional cost to complete the audit engagement.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>.133</b> In all circumstances, if the audit procedures are substantially complete or the cost to complete such procedures is relatively insignificant, the accountant should consider the propriety of accepting a change in the engagement.</p>
        <p><b>.134</b> If the accountant concludes, based upon the accountant’s professional judgment, that reasonable justification exists to change the engagement, and if the accountant complies with the standards applicable to a review engagement, the accountant should issue an appropriate review report.</p>
        <p>.<b>135</b> The report should not include reference to:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p>The original engagement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Any audit procedures that may have been performed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Scope limitations that resulted in the changed engagement.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>.136</b> When the accountant has been engaged to audit an entity&apos;s financial statements and management refuses to allow the accountant to correspond with the entity&apos;s legal counsel, the accountant, except in rare circumstances, is precluded from accepting an engagement to review those financial statements.</p>
