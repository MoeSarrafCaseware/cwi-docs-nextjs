        <h1>SoQM</h1>
        <p>In the <b>OPERATE</b> module, the <b>SoQM</b> tab provides all users with access to the firm’s published system of quality management, displaying each objective with their associated quality risks, policy and procedure responses and tasks.</p>
        <h2>Expand and collapse all content</h2>
        <p>The default view of the system of quality management only displays the firm&apos;s quality objectives.</p>
        <p>To expand the linked quality risks with their responses, click <b>Expand All</b>. The expanded view uses different colours to distinguish between objectives, quality risks, policy responses, procedure responses and tasks, making them easy to identify.</p>

        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/2SoQM summary.jpg" alt="SoQM Summary." /></p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/3 SoQM summary.png" alt="SoQM Summary." /></p>
        <p>To collapse all content, click on <b>Collapse All</b>.</p>
        <p>Only the quality objectives will display.</p>

        <h2>Expand or collapse one section at a time</h2>
        <h3>Expand sections</h3>
        <p>Users can expand sections individually. For example, to view all sub-items related to a specific objective only, click on the expand button.</p>
        <p>All the sub-items linked to the objective will then be expanded.</p>
        <h3>Collapse sections</h3>
        <p>Users can also collapse all sub-items within an individual item.</p>
        <p>To collapse sub-items, click on the collapse button of the sub-item you want to collapse. The sub-items will be collapsed and only the item will be visible.</p>
        <h2>Expand and collapse individual line items</h2>
        <p>Users can expand or collapse individual line items one at a time by clicking on the expand or collapse button next to the linked item. This allows users to focus on specific details, such as risks related to objectives.</p>
        <p>In the example shown below, the risk linked to the objective is visible.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/5 Expand and collapse individual line items.png" alt="Expand and collapse individual line items." /></p>
        <h2>View dialogues of individual items</h2>
        <p>Users can view the details of an individual objective, risk, policy, procedure or task by clicking on the field that contains the title and details of the item.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/6 View dialogs of individual items.png" alt="View dialogues of individual items." /></p>
        <p>The dialog of that item will open in read-only format.</p>
        <p>To close the dialog and return to the published system of quality management, click <b>Close</b>.</p>
