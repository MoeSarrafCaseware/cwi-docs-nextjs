        <h1>Procedure responses</h1>
        <p>In the <b>DESIGN</b> module, the <b>Procedure responses</b> tab is where system designers document how to put the firm’s policy responses into action.</p>
        <h2>Define procedure responses</h2>
        <p>There are 3 types of procedure responses.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Mandatory procedure responses</b> - These procedure responses are prescribed by the firm’s applicable quality management standard. The firm must assess their relevance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Network procedure responses</b> - These procedure responses are prescribed by the firm’s network firm, where relevant. The network firm will distribute the prescribed procedure responses, which are then imported in Settings. The firm must assess their relevance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Firm procedure responses</b> - These procedure responses are recorded by the firm and are in addition to the mandatory and network procedure responses.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Complete procedure response</h2>
        <p>To complete the <b>Procedure response</b> dialogue, system designers can add a new procedure response or modify an existing procedure response already included in the table.</p>
        <p>To modify a procedure response see, <a href="#Modify_a_procedure_response">Modify a procedure response</a>.</p>
        <p><b>To add a new procedure response:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <b>Add</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/-Add.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) and select, <b>Procedure response</b>.</p>
                <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Add a procedure response 1.png" alt="Add a procedure response." /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Complete the <b>Procedure response</b> dialogue box.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The <b>Procedure response</b> dialogue contains the following fields to be completed:</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> When completing a mandatory or network procedure response, some of the fields will be pre-populated and cannot be modified.</p>
