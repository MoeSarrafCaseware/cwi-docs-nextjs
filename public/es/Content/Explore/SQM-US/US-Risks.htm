        <h1>Riesgos</h1>
        <p>In the <b>DESIGN</b> module, the <b>Risks</b> tab is where system designers document and evaluate the firm’s quality risks. Risks are documented when there is a potential for adverse effects on one or more of the firm’s quality objectives.</p>
        <h2>Define risks</h2>
        <p>There are 2 types of risks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Network risks</b> - These risks are prescribed by the firm’s network firm, where relevant.</p>
                <p>The network firm will distribute the prescribed risks, which are then imported in Settings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Firm risks</b> - These risks are recorded by the firm and are in addition to the network risks.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> There are no mandatory risks prescribed by the applicable quality management standards.</p>
        <h2>Complete a risk</h2>
        <p>To complete the <b>Risk</b> dialogue, system designers can add a new risk or modify a risk from the list of risks already included in the table.</p>
        <p>To modify a risk see, <a href="#Modify_a_risk">Modify a risk</a>.</p>
