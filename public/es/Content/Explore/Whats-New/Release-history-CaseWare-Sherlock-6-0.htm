        <h1>Novedades - Working Papers 6,0</h1>
        <p>Find out what&apos;s new in Caseware Sherlock 6.0.</p>
        <h2>userv2 and issuev2 datasets</h2>
        <p>We&apos;ve introduced two new datasets — <b>userv2</b> and <b>issuev2</b>. These datasets function similarly to the existing <b>user</b> and <b>issue</b> datasets, but with users&apos; identities decrypted. This means that visualizations that would previously display an encrypted GUID to hide users&apos; names (with <b>user</b> or <b>issue</b>) can now display their full names (with <b>userv2</b> or <b>issuev2</b>).</p>
        <h2>Synchronization with Cloud user groups</h2>
        <p>To streamline the process of sharing visualizations, Sherlock now synchronizes with Cloud user groups. This enables Sherlock Builder users to share their visualizations in bulk with entire Cloud groups, rather than manually selecting individual users.</p>
