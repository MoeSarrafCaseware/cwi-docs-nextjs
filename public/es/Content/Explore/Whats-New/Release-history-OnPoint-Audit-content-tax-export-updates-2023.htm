        <p>Here is what’s new in OnPoint Audit Annual Content Updates 2023 release.</p>

        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/NPO-Financial-statements.png" alt="NPO Financial statements." /></p>
        <h2>Annual content updates</h2>
        <p>OnPoint Audit checklists and other documents have now been updated to meet all standards effective for audits of financial statements for <b>periods ending on or after December 15, 2023,</b> including <i>SAS 143 - Auditing accounting estimates and related disclosures</i> and <i>SAS 145 - Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement</i>.</p>
        <p>To address the requirements of <i>SAS 145 - Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement</i>, several enhancements were made to the controls evaluation workflow within OnPoint Audit. A new form, <b>3-300 Controls evaluation - Assertion level controls</b>, is now available to be used in conjunction with the existing controls report in the <b>Risk &amp; controls</b> tab. You can now use this form to document all identified controls, including the details of any significant risks that they address, assessment of the control design and implementation and identification of any control deficiencies.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/2-Controls-evaluation.png" alt="3-300 Controls evaluation - Assertion level controls form." /></p>
        <p>A new table was also added to the existing <b>7-400 Significant decisions, audit findings and matters for future consideration</b> checklist to document details of any control deficiencies identified and to determine whether they, individually or in aggregate, result in a material weakness or a significant deficiency.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/3-Document-control-deficiencies.png" alt="Checklist to document details of control deficiencies identified." /></p>
        <p>Additional lightbulb guidance for inherent risk has been included on the <b>Risk Assessment</b> tab within the <b>2-900 Risk report</b> to inform users about the specific requirements for inherent risk assessment as defined in <i>SAS 145 - Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement</i>.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/4-Inherent-risk-guidance.png" alt="Inherent risk guidance." /></p>

        <h2>Accounting estimates workflow enhancements</h2>
        <p>Several enhancements were made to the accounting estimates workflow in OnPoint Audit to better address the requirements of <i>SAS 143 - Auditing accounting estimates and related disclosures</i>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>2-700 Understanding accounting estimates and disclosures</b> has been condensed to ensure a more efficient workflow through the audit work programs and into the respective accounting estimates forms in the <b>Fieldwork</b> phase.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>2-750 Outcome of prior period accounting estimates</b> form was removed to reduce redundancies as the prior period accounting estimates are now addressed in the accounting estimates forms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>6-130 Accounting estimates</b> checklist was removed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>New procedures have been added within the accounting estimates forms, replacing previous lightbulb guidance, to ensure completion of required steps as defined in the new standards.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>New features and enhancements in OnPoint Audit</h2>
        <p>In addition to the content updates and workflow improvements, we have included the following new features and enhancements in OnPoint Audit.</p>
        <h3>Modify financial group names</h3>
        <p>Users can now modify the names of financial groups from the <b>Data</b> page. Note that when a group name is modified, the updated name will be used for the group regardless of sign changes and will override the consistent, contrary and inconsistent names of the group. Users also have the option to revert their changes from the Group properties dialog.</p>
        <h3>Numbered headings for notes and text areas in the financial statements</h3>
        <p>To further enhance the presentation of the default financial statements, new options have been added to customize numbering styles for headings.</p>
        <p>In the financial statements there are now new options to customize numbered headings. The number of heading levels has been increased to five and you can now customize the numbering style of the headings. You can also now add headings with or without numbering to any text areas in the financial statements.</p>
        <p>Users can access and customize the numbered heading settings by selecting the <b>Numbered Heading Options</b> from the <b>Document settings</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/settings-icon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />).</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/5-Numbered-heading-options.png" alt="Opciones de títulos numerados" /></p>
        <p>In the dialog, you can select whether to enable numbering for your headings, view what the current selected numbering format is and select a new format from the available options.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/6-Numbered-heading-options.png" alt="Opciones de títulos numerados" style="width: 495px;height: 729px;" /></p>
        <p>Note that for area headings, in addition to the options available for note headings, you also have the option to select a numbering format for area titles displayed in the Document Map.</p>
