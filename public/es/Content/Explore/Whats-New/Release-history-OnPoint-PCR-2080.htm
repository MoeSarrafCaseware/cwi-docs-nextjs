        <h1>What&apos;s new - OnPoint PCR 20.8.0</h1>
        <h2>Financial statements customization</h2>
        <p>In order to create a more efficient workflow, procedures related to financial statement customization have been moved from the <b>Financial Statement Optimizer</b> section in the <b>1-110 Engagement Setup</b> checklist to a new checklist, <b>3-100 Financial Statement Setup</b>. Note that procedures related to financial statements that affect engagement letters remain in the <b>1-110 Engagement Setup</b> document.</p>

        <h2>Firma electrónica simple</h2>
        <p>To support scenarios where clients are required to sign documents or accept certain terms during the engagement, a new response type <b>Simple Electronic Signature</b> is now available in queries.</p>
        <p><b>Simple Electronic Signature</b> provides a paperless, secure and more efficient method for signing documents. Once you send the query to clients, they can sign the document or agree to terms with a single tap or button click. Note that clients will still have the option to manually sign and upload the documents.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/pcr-esig-query.png" alt="A query with the Simple Electronic Signature response type." /></p>
        <p>If clients choose to accept the document electronically, a signature log is generated and available for download. The log includes the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Query question details</p>
