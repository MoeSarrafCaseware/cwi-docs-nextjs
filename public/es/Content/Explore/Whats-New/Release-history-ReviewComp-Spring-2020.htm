        <p>Here is a listing of what&apos;s new for the <b>Spring 2020</b> release of Caseware ReviewComp.</p>
        <h2>Support for the CSRS 4200 standard</h2>
        <p>Caseware ReviewComp now supports the new CSRS 4200 standard. To learn more, see <a href="../Caseware-ReviewComp/Implement-the-4200-Compilation-standards.htm">Implement the 4200 Compilation standards.</a></p>

        <h2>Redondeo</h2>
        <p>Rounding is now automatically applied in the financial statements. The asterisk (*) marks the row where the rounding differences are applied. The default group where rounding is applied is <i>Accounts Receivables.</i></p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/AR-rounding.PNG" alt="The asterisk (*) marks Accounts receivable row to denote that rounding differences apply to this account." /></p>
        <p>You can change the default and have rounding apply to a different account by selecting the asterisk (*). To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Statements-and-Conclusions/Rounding-in-financial-statements.htm">Rounding in financial statements</a>, <a href="../../Engagements/Accounts-and-Analysis/Review-group-and-account-balances-in-the-financial-statements.htm#View2">View rounding details</a> and <a href="../../Engagements/Accounts-and-Analysis/Review-group-and-account-balances-in-the-financial-statements.htm#Change">Change the account where rounding applies</a>.</p>
        <h2>Área del estado financiero (AEF)</h2>
        <p>For a more efficient reconciliation process, an automatic balance check process is now available in the financial statements. The process seamlessly runs in the background detecting discrepancies in line items and note disclosures across all areas, as well as marking them.</p>
        <p>An icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-discrepancy.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) displays next to areas with discrepancies detected so you can easily spot them. Clicking the icon opens a popup that displays the details of the detected discrepancies (account names and balances). To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Accounts-and-Analysis/Review-group-and-account-balances-in-the-financial-statements.htm#View">View balance discrepancies in financial statements.</a></p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/balance-check1.png" alt="Discrepancies are automatically detected and marked by the red icon." /></p>
        <p>With this feature, a new review tool <b>Balance Check i</b>s also available. It marks all areas that have been checked, highlighting locations with discrepancies and locations where balances agree. To learn more, see <a href="../Interface/CaseWareCloud-SE/Work-with-Review-Tools.htm#Review">Review content changes in the financial statements document</a>.</p>
