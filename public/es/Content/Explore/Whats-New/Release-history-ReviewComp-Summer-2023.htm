        <h1>What&apos;s new - Caseware ReviewComp Summer 2023 (v1.2725.0)</h1>
        <p>Here is a listing of what&apos;s new for the Caseware ReviewComp Summer 2023 release.</p>
        <h2>New property, plant and equipment worksheet</h2>
        <p>The <b>3-U-1 Worksheet - Property, plant and equipment</b> worksheet is now available. In addition to automatically pulling balances from your imported data using Caseware Cloud Connector, this form also uses automated formulas to make it easier for you to track your additions, disposals and amortization amounts.</p>
        <h2>New allocation worksheet</h2>
        <p>The <b>2-11 Allocation overview worksheet</b> is now available. This allocation worksheet is designed to assist in managing your fund balances to implement fund reporting in the financial statements. With this worksheet, you can set automated allocation methods to easily allocate your trial balance accounts to the appropriate funds and identify any unallocated balances.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="../Caseware-ReviewComp/Complete-the-Allocation-overview-worksheet.htm">Complete the Allocation overview worksheet</a>.</p>
        <h2>Removal of parent-level assignment ability for financial groups</h2>
        <p>You can now only assign accounts to subgroups in the financial grouping structure.</p>
        <p>While previously you could assign accounts to some parent-level groups, in order to provide a more consistent experience when assigning accounts, this ability has been removed.</p>
        <h2>Edit author-created dimensions</h2>
        <p>You can now edit dimensions created by firm authors. Note that you cannot delete dimensions created by authors.</p>
        <p>Para más información, consulte <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Add-dimensions.htm">Añadir zonas</a>.</p>
        <h2>File restoration</h2>
        <p>You can now restore and download deleted third-party files from the new Recycle Bin. Examples of third-party files include Word, Excel and PDF documents.</p>
        <p>When you delete a third-party file, the <b>Recycle Bin</b> option appears in the left pane of the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/reviewcomp-recycle-bin.png" alt="La opción Papelera de reciclaje de la página Documentos."></img></p>
        <p>When you navigate to the Recycle Bin page, you can view a list of deleted documents and select to download them or view the file history from the <b>More actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-more-actions.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"></img>) menu.</p>
        <p>From the File History page, you can view all previous versions of the document and select a version to restore.</p>
        <p>Note that the ability to restore files directly from the Recycle Bin will be available at a later date.</p>

        <h2>Duplicate adjustments</h2>
        <p>You can now use the Duplicate option to duplicate adjustments. Cuando se duplica un ajuste, el nuevo ajuste tiene el mismo tipo, descripción y detalles de cuenta que el ajuste original.</p>
        <p>Note that any annotations, issues or signoffs associated with the adjustment are not copied, and the duplicate adjustment defaults to the current year even if the original adjustment is for the prior year.</p>

        <h2>Fix</h2>
