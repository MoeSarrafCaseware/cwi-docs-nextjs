        <p>Here is a listing of what&apos;s new for version <b>26.0</b> of CasewareCloud Time.</p>
        <h2 id="export">Ability to export invoices to QuickBooks Online</h2>
        <p>Administrators can now link Cloud with an existing QuickBooks Online (QBO) account. Invoices can then be exported directly to QBO to track payments and manage receivables. To learn more about exporting invoices, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Practice/Time-and-Billing/Integrate-online-accounting-software-with-Cloud.htm">Integrate Cloud with QuickBooks Online</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <h2 id="ability">Ability to disable GL features</h2>
        <p>Administrators can now disable general ledger (GL) features. This ensures that only necessary information is collected during the billing process. If an organization has never used GL features, GL will be disabled during migration to 26.0. New organizations will have GL features disabled by default. Administrators can enable or disable GL features by selecting <b>Firm Settings | Time | General | Time and Expense Settings | Enable general ledger</b>.</p>
