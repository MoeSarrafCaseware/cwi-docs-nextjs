        <h2>New features and enhancements in Cloud engagements</h2>
        <h3><a name="Embedded"></a>Embedded analytics</h3>
        <p><b>Comprobación de asientos de diario</b></p>
        <p>This update eliminates the current forms in OnPoint Audit and replaces them with the new capability to link embedded analytical tests to specific procedures.</p>
        <p>The following documents have been removed from the product:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>6-230 Influencers for analytics insights</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>6-250 Analytics insights</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Applicable analytic tests have been embedded next to procedures in 6-200 Testing of journal entries.</p>
        <p><b>Centro de análisis</b></p>
        <p>This release introduces the Analytics Hub. The Analytics Hub is a central location that you can use to view a list of all analytic tests linked to a checklist. When you select a test, you can view configuration details as well as a list of checklist procedures linked to the test.</p>
        <p>In your engagement, select the Analytics Hub page to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>View all analytic tests available in your engagement</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Filter tests</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make adjustments to test configurations</p>

        </ul>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/AnalyticsHub-OnPoint.png" alt="Viewing the Analytics Hub in OnPoint Audit." /></p>
        <p>In addition to the ability to view results for an individual test, this release also features the introduction of the Aggregated Results page. This page lets you view all transactions identified as part of any analytic test in one location. You can also filter and export results to a CSV file.</p>
        <p>This new feature gives you a holistic view of test results and makes it easier to derive insights from your data.</p>

        <h3><a name="NewUI-TB"></a>New user interface for importing trial balance data from Excel or CSV files</h3>
        <p>We’ve revamped the user interface for importing trial balance data from Excel or CSV files to support engagement files with a much greater number of accounts, as well as to bring us closer to providing a more tightly integrated, polished data acquisition user experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You can now import Excel files containing formulas. This means you will no longer have to manually remove formulas to calculate values before importing your data.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Opciones de balance de comprobación</p>

        <h3><a name="Central"></a>Planificación central</h3>
        <p>Central planning allows you to sync risks, controls and selected checklists across engagements so the work doesn’t need to be duplicated in multiple engagements.</p>
        <p>Select <b>Set as Central Planning Engagement</b> in Engagement Settings to designate engagements as central planning engagements.</p>
        <p>Note that this action is irreversible. Once an engagement is set as a central planning engagement, the checkbox cannot be deselected.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/EngagementSettings-OnPointAudit.png" alt="Setting an engagement as a central planning engagement" /></p>
        <p>To create an engagement that is synced to the central planning engagement, navigate to the central planning engagement in your Cloud site and use the <b>Create Engagement from Source</b> option. Risks, controls and selected checklists in this new engagement will then automatically be synced from the central planning engagement.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/CreateEngagementFromSource-OnPoint.png" alt="Create an engagement that is synced to a central planning engagement" /></p>
        <p>In both central planning engagements and destination engagements that are synced to the central planning engagement, the <b>Central planning</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/CentralPlanningIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) icon displays in the top menu bar. Note that the icon also displays next to the synced checklists.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/SyncedChecklistExample-OnPointAudit.png" alt="Viewing a synced checklist in OnPoint Audit." /></p>
        <p>You can select the <b>Central planning</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/CentralPlanningIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) icon in the top menu bar to open the <b>Central Planning Hub</b>. If you are in the central planning engagement, you can view a list of the destination engagements and whether they are up to date. If you’re in a destination engagement, this page informs you if any changes have been made in the source engagement and allows you to sync those changes.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/CentralPlanningHub.png" alt="Central Planning Hub allows you to view changes in a source engagement and to sync those changes." /></p>
        <p>If you open a synced checklist in a destination engagement, a message appears informing you that the document has been completed in the central planning engagement, along with a link to the checklist in that engagement. Risks and controls will continue to appear in the destination engagements but remain in a read-only state.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/OpeningSyncedChecklist-OnPointAudit.png" alt="Opening a synced checklist in OnPoint Audit." /></p>
        <h4>Autor de la empresa</h4>
        <p>Firm authors can modify which checklists are included when syncing to a central planning engagement. This allows firm authors to customize central planning to suit their firm and needs, as well as to include firm author-created checklists.</p>
        <p>In Product Settings, select Central Planning and then select which checklist documents in your template are synced. All risks and controls are synced by default. See <a href="../../Engagements/Template-and-Authoring/Access-the-product-settings.htm">Access the product settings</a>, for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Import"></a>Import planning balances after final balances</h3>
        <p>You can now import planning trial balances after importing the final trial balances. This new functionality allows you to update planning data, if necessary, before starting work on your engagement.</p>
        <h3><a name="Identifying"></a>Identifying errors in Excel/CSV imports</h3>
        <p>When you assign fields to columns for files imported from Excel or CSV, an indicator now displays for any columns that contain errors. You can then select the indicator and the error to view more information about the error and the specific rows that have been flagged.</p>
        <p>This makes it easier to identify and fix errors before reuploading any files.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/IdentifyErrorsInCSV-ExcelImports.png" alt="Identifying errors in Excel or CSV file imports." /></p>
        <h3>Automatic header row detection during import of Excel files</h3>
        <p>When you import data from Excel, the header row of your data is now automatically identified. This functionality already exists for CSV imports. In addition, you can now view the automatically detected header row for both Excel and CSV imports.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/AutomaticHeaderDetection.png" alt="Automatic header row detection in a data import." /></p>
        <p>If the selected row is incorrect, you can select the <b>Adjust header row</b> button to manually select a new header row.</p>
        <p>Note that both the automatic header detection and manual header selection only take into account the first 30 rows of the imported file. Rows beyond the first 30 cannot be selected as a header.</p>
