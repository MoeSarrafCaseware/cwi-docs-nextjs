        <h1>consolidación</h1>
        <p>The process of combining several <a href="../E/entity.htm">entities</a> into one engagement file to publish consolidated or combined financial statements. This process is typically used when a parent company owns or controls one or more subsidiary companies or segregates its business into multiple components.</p>
        <p>In a consolidation engagement, you must first define the consolidation hierarchy, which describes the relationship between a parent company and its entities.</p>
