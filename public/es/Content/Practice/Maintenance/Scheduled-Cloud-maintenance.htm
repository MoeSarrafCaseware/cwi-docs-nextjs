        <h1>Mantenimiento programado de Caseware Cloud</h1>
        <p>We perform periodic updates to improve the performance, security, and the usability of Caseware Cloud. However, to provide you with these updates, the server will be temporarily unavailable.</p>
        <p>We understand that saving your work is important and therefore we will send an email alert of the upcoming planned maintenance one week in advanced. Prior to the start of the update period, we recommend that you save your work and log out of Caseware Cloud. If you are using Working Papers SmartSync, you can continue to work on your files offline.</p>
        <p>During the downtime, we will also send you status updates so that you are aware when the scheduled maintenance is completed.</p>
