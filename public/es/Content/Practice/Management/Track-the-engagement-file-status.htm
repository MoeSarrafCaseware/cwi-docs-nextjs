        <p>Select a workflow stage from this menu to apply it to the engagement.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: The workflow status automatically changes when you complete certain parts of the engagement. For example, when you upload the trial balance into your engagement file, the workflow stage is automatically changed to <b>In Progress</b>.</p>
