        <h1>Create accounts for staff members</h1>
        <p>Once you create entities for each of your clients, grant Cloud access to other staff members in your firm. You can create a new account for each staff member who needs to collaborate on your engagements. After you create accounts for your staff members, you can assign them security roles to determine the level of access they have to your firm. The following table briefly describes the roles you can assign your staff members. For more details, see <a href="../../Setup/Security/Built-in-roles.htm">Built-in roles</a>.</p>
