        <h1>Crear una cuenta para el personal o los contactos</h1>
        <p>One of the major benefits of Caseware Cloud is that you can collaborate directly with your clients on engagements. You need to set up a contact account so your clients can access their engagement file.</p>
        <h2>Practice set</h2>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Contacts</b>. This takes you to the Contacts page.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New</b>, then <b>ADD | Contacts</b>. The Add Contact dialog displays.</p>
        <p><b>General</b></p>
        <p>Enter a first and last name and an email address for your client contact. In the Entity field, select the client entity that you created earlier. Once you have selected the client entity, select the <b>Contact - Entity Collaborator</b> role to set the access level for this account. This role allows your client to create discussions, tasks, and file requests on Cloud. It also allows them to collaborate on engagements for Cloud apps.</p>
        <p><b>Contraseña</b></p>
        <p>The same password options for staff accounts apply here. Because the email address is yours, choose <b>Set</b> and uncheck <b>User must change password on next sign in</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Grupos</b></p>
        <p>Contact groups work the same way as staff groups. The contact group available out of the box is <b>All Contacts</b> and by default, your client is automatically a member of that group.</p>
        <p><b>Apps</b></p>
        <p>Just like the <b>All Staff</b> group, the <b>All Contacts</b> group grants its members the ability to view and create engagements for all the available Cloud apps.</p>
        <p>Once you finish setting up your client contact&apos;s new account, select <b>Save</b>. They will receive a welcome email from Cloud notifying them that their account has been created and instructing them on how to log in.</p>
