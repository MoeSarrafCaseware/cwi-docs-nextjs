        <h1>Procedimientos iniciales</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>Before you can start work on any ReviewComp engagements, you need to set up the Caseware Cloud portal for your organization. For information, refer to <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Explore/Getting-Started/Get-started-with-CaseWare-RCT-Firm-Admin.htm">Get Started with Caseware ReviewComp - Firm Administrator</a> and <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Explore/Getting-Started/Get-started-with-CaseWare-RCT.htm">Get Started with Caseware ReviewComp - Staff</a>.</p>
        <p>Once you have set up your portal, you can continue with the exercises in this guide.</p>
        <p>This chapter walks you through the process for completing these setup steps. Once the following steps are complete, you will be ready to create an engagement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up workspaces in Caseware Cloud for each of your clients</li>
            <li>Create accounts for your staff members</li>
            <li>Create accounts for your clients</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Crear un nuevo proyecto</h2>
        <p>An entity is a workspace that you can use to organize and collaborate on your engagement from a single location for a client. You will need to create a new entity for each client.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: The instructions below explain the process for adding an individual client entity. You can also import a list of your clients in order to create all of your client entities at once. For more information, refer to <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Setup/Organization/Create-client-entities.htm#Creatingcliententitiesfromaclientlist">Create client entities</a>.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>From the Cloud menu (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/cloud-menu.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />), select <b>Entities</b>. This takes you to the Entities page.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New</b>, and then select <b>Clients</b>. The Create Entity dialog is displayed.</p>
        <p>For each of the sections below, enter the information shown.</p><div class="nobreak"><h4><b style="font-size: 12pt;">General Info</b></h4>
            <p><b>Note</b>: Leave <b>Business Number</b> with default content.</p>
            <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/create-entity-general-info.png" alt="Create entity - general info" /></p></div> <div class="nobreak"><h4><b>TELÉFONO</b></h4>
            <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/create-entity-phone.png" alt="Crear asociaciones de entidades" /></p></div> <div class="nobreak"><h4><b>dirección</b></h4>
            <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/create-entity-addresses-business.png" alt="Crear asociaciones de entidades" /></p></div> <div class="nobreak"><h4><b>Perfil</b></h4>
            <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/rct-training-entity-profile.png" alt="Crear asociaciones de entidades" /></p></div> <div class="nobreak"><h4><b>Códigos de industria</b></h4>
            <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/rct-training-entity-industry-codes.png" alt="Create entity - industry codes" /></p></div> <div class="nobreak"><h4><b>Historial</b></h4>
            <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/create-entity-history.png" alt="Crear asociaciones de entidades" /></p></div><p>Once you have finished entering all of the relevant information for your client, select <b>Save</b>. The client entity is created, and you can see it added to the Entities list.</p>
        <h2>Create accounts for your staff members</h2>
        <p>Once you have created entities for each of your clients, you will be ready to grant access to your Cloud firm to other staff members in your organization. You can create a new account for each staff member who will need to collaborate on your engagements.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: The instructions below explain the process for adding individual staff members. You can also import a list of your staff members in order to create all of their user profiles at once. Para obtener más información, consulte la Ayuda de IDEA.</p>
        <p>From the Cloud menu (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/cloud-menu.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />), select <b>Staff</b>. This takes you to the Staff page.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New</b>, and then under Add, select <b>Staff</b>. The Add Staff dialog is displayed. Just as you saw when creating an entity, there are different areas where you will enter information about the new account.</p>
        <h4><b>General</b></h4>
        <p>Enter an email address and a first and last name for the new staff member. The email address will be the username for their account, and they will log into Cloud with it.</p>
        <p>The First Name, Last Name, and Email (or Username) fields are mandatory.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/add-staff-general.png" alt="Add staff general" /></p><div class="nobreak"><h4><b>Contraseña</b></h4>
            <p>You can choose how the password for the new account will be set:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Set by User</b> - the staff member will set their own password when they first log in. Caseware ReviewComp sends an email with instructions on how to log in to the portal.</li>
                <li><b>Auto Generated</b> - a random password is chosen by Caseware ReviewComp. It does not send an email to the staff member, so you will need to provide them with the login page URL, their user ID and their password.</li>
                <li><b>Set</b> - you choose a password for the staff member. Caseware ReviewComp does not send an email, so you will need to provide them with their login information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Leave the password option as <b>Set by User</b>.</p>
            <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/add-staff-password.png" alt="Add staff - password set by user" /></p></div> <div class="nobreak"><h4><b>Grupos</b></h4>
            <p>You can assign the staff member&apos;s account to one or more staff groups. If you create groups, you can specify permissions and access levels for members of that group, and then any accounts that you add as group members automatically inherit those settings.</p>
            <p>Caseware ReviewComp only includes the <b>All Staff</b> group by default, and any staff members are automatically included in the group, so you won&apos;t have to do anything in this section.</p>
            <p>Leave this page as is.</p></div><h4><b>Apps</b></h4>
        <p>You can grant access to apps to your staff member. You can grant the staff member the ability to view engagements for an app and the ability to create new engagements or files for it.</p>
        <p>Note that by default, the <b>All Staff</b> group includes the ability to view and create engagements for all of the apps. This simplifies access, but if you need to control access to some apps more tightly, you can remove some of those permissions from the global group. This would enable you to pick and choose which staff members should be able to work with certain apps.</p>
        <h4><b>Standard Hours</b></h4>
        <p>The settings for Staff Standard Hours are only applicable to your organization if you use the CasewareCloud Time app to handle time and expense entries. Leave this section set to <b>Organization standard hours</b>.</p>
        <p>Once you have finished entering all of the information for your staff member&apos;s new account, select <b>Save</b>. They will receive a welcome email notifying them that their account has been created and instructing them on how to log in.</p>
        <h2>Crear entidades de cliente</h2>
        <p>One of the major benefits of ReviewComp is that you can collaborate directly with your clients on engagements. For your clients to access their engagement, you need to set up a contact account for them on Cloud.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>From the Cloud menu (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/cloud-menu.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />), select <b>Contacts</b>. This takes you to the Contacts page.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New</b>, and then under Add, select <b>Contact</b>. The Add Contact dialog is displayed.</p>
        <h4><b>General</b></h4>
        <p>Enter a first and last name and an email address for your client contact.</p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: To avoid potential issues, be sure to use a valid email address.</p>
        <p>In the <b>Entity</b> field, select the client entity that you created earlier. Once you have selected the client entity, select the <b>Contact - Entity Collaborator</b> role to set the access level for this account. The entity collaborator role lets your client create discussions, tasks, and file requests, and lets them collaborate on engagements.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/add-contact-general.png" alt="Agregar instrucciones de contacto" /></p><div class="nobreak"><h4><b>Contraseña</b></h4>
            <p>The same password options that you had when creating your staff accounts are also available here. Leave the password option as <b>Set by User</b>.</p>
            <h4><b>Grupos</b></h4>
            <p>Contact groups work the same way that staff groups do. By default, the only contact group is <b>All Contacts</b> — your client will automatically be part of that group.</p>
            <p>Leave this page as-is.</p></div><h4><b>Apps</b></h4>
        <p>The <b>All Contacts</b> group automatically grants client contacts the ability to view engagements or files for all app types in Cloud. Review the permissions and make sure that your contact can view Caseware ReviewComp engagements.</p>
        <p>Once you have finished entering all of the information for your client contact&apos;s account, select <b>Save</b>. They will receive a welcome email notifying them that their account has been created and instructing them on how to log in.</p>
