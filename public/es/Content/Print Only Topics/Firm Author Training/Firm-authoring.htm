        <p class="instNotes">Today, we show you how firms can customize <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PrintGuides.RCT">Caseware ReviewComp</MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PrintGuides.OnPoint">OnPoint PCR</MadCap:conditionalText>. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PrintGuides.OnPoint">We believe that the AICPA has done an exceptional job in covering most of the necessary content to perform PCR engagements. However, there might be areas where firms need to add their own personal touch in the program. </MadCap:conditionalText>Customizing the product for your firm is the exception, and not the rule. This means that we want firms spending more time using the product and less time customizing the product.</p>
        <p class="instNotes">Before we start the training, it is important to note that one of the benefits of our cloud based product is that Caseware, <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PrintGuides.OnPoint">in conjunction with the AICPA, </MadCap:conditionalText>is able to release a new version of a product on a quarterly basis. This helps us update the product with fixes and new features in a timely manner, to provide innovative solutions in a rapidly evolving industry. Most desktop products in the market currently use the yearly release model.</p>
