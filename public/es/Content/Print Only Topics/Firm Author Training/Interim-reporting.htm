        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">Perform interim engagements</h1>
        <p>In an interim engagement, users can perform monthly, quarterly and semi-annual interim engagements, including comparative periods. However, they can only perform one type of engagement per interim period throughout the year. For example, they can only perform a review engagement in a specific interim period.</p>
        <p>If a different type of engagement is performed at year end, users need to set up a new engagement for that period. One engagement letter is created in the first period file and covers all interim engagements. However, multiple reports and financial statements are created for each period. The signed engagement letter will roll forward during each covered period.</p>
        <p>When importing from a CSV or an Excel file, users can define the periods during the import.</p>
