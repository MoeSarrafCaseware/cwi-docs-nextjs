        <h3>About this guide</h3>
        <p>The practice aids in this guide have been designed for a small- and medium-sized non-public company. They do not address the wide range of circumstances or specific industry issues that may exist for a particular client or groups of clients (such as those operating in a specialized industry, government or non-profit organization or complex IT environments). Consequently, the forms should always be tailored to address the known facts and circumstances of each engagement.</p>
