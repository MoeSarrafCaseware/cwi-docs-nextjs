        <h1>Perform fieldwork</h1>
        <p>You have completed all of the steps involved in adding the trial balance information to your engagement file. You have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>submitted and accepted a PBC procedure for the client&apos;s trial balance file</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Importar el balance de comprobación de un archivo de encargo</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>assigned an unassigned account and corrected the mapping</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>added an annotation to the trial balance</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now it&apos;s time to start fieldwork. In this section, we cover various fieldwork scenarios.</p>
        <h2>Defina el rango para la extracción.</h2>
        <p>To define the scope of the engagement relative to the relevant financial statements areas, open the <b>2-100 Review - Overall Analysis</b> document. Various sections are available in the document as you provide responses to the procedures in this checklist.</p>

        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The <b>Additional Procedures</b> section is only available in the document if you have imported the trial balance data.</p>
        <h2>Complete the materiality document</h2>
        <p>The materiality document is a form where you can define thresholds for overall materiality, performance and trivial misstatements to keep track of benchmarks.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the <b>2-102 Materiality</b> document.</p>

        <h2>Respond to work program procedures</h2>
        <p>On the <b>Documents</b> page there is a series of checklist documents under the <b>Fieldwork</b> section. These checklists are lead sheet documents (or work programs) that you will use to guide your analysis and document the results of your inquiries for the relevant financial statement areas.</p>
        <p>Work programs have several features that help you complete them easily and quickly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>linked procedure responses</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>an analysis section</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>document guidance</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the top of each document, there is an <b>Analysis</b> tab that pulls information from the trial balance and presents it visually. A work program also includes a <b>Guidance</b> tab.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>Open the <b>Cash and Cash Equivalents</b> document.</p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: You must answer <i>Yes</i> in question 5 (Cash and Cash Equivalents?) in the <b>2-100 Review - Overall Analysis</b> document for the <b>Cash and Cash Equivalents</b> document to be available.</p>
        <p>Switch to the <b>Analysis</b> tab. The analysis section presents data in tables or graphs. It only includes trial balance information for relevant accounts and groups which helps you identify items that you need to inquire about from your client.</p>
        <p>You can view either preliminary or final balances using the drop-down menu at the top of the tab. The toggles allow you to choose which information (such as <b>Accounts</b>) shows on the tab. Each figure also has a text field where you can add comments about the data displayed.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-cash-and-cash-equiv-analysis.png" alt="OnPoint PCR - Cash and cash equivalents - Analysis" /></p>
        <p>Switch to the <b>Guidance</b> tab to view the available guidance information.</p>
        <p>Now go back to <b>Procedures</b> tab.</p>
        <p>The <b>Procedures</b> tab contains questions to be answered or fields to fill in. If you are using the <b>2-106 PBC Requests- Review Inquiries</b> query document to gather information from your client, you may see linked query responses under some procedures.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/pcr-cash-cash-q3.png" alt="OnPoint PCR - Cash and cash equivalent - procedures - client response" /></p>
        <p><b>Linked query responses</b> are response areas that are linked to matching questions in the <b>PBC Requests - Review Inquiries</b> query document. When you accept a response from a client in this query, the linked query response is displayed under the matching procedure in the checklist document.</p>
        <h2>Request additional information from the client</h2>
        <p>You are working on the <b>2-115 Cash and Cash Equivalents</b> document, and you reach a procedure that asks<b> What procedures are in place to ensure that all cash and cash equivalents accounts are reconciled on a timely basis?</b></p>
        <p>In the analysis section, you noticed that the cash total for this year is much higher than the totals from the prior years. You decide to contact the customer to ask them to verify the response to this question, since a late cutoff could have inflated the current year total.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>From the Documents page, open the <b>2-106 PBC Requests - Review Inquiries</b> document.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> For the purpose of this training, the <b>Review Inquiries</b> document includes linked queries for many different documents. In real life, you should identify all the questions where you need client input and delete all other questions from the query before you send it to the client.</p>
        <p>Select <b>SEND</b> to display the Open Query dialog, and complete the dialog as required.</p>
        <p>The client can enter information for the specific question and mark it as completed. You will see this response in the <b>PBC Requests - Review Inquiries</b> document. If you are satisfied with the information they have provided, then you can select <b>Accept</b>.</p>
        <p>Notice how the time of the response and the name of the contact that has responded to each query question displays in the query document.</p>
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/query-question-client-responded.png" alt="A query question with a response provided by the client." /></p>
        <p>Once you have accepted the client response in the query, you should see the response in the linked procedure in the Checklist document.</p>
        <p>Once you&apos;re satisfied with the information your client has provided and if procedure sign offs are available, you can sign off the procedure by selecting the <b>Sign Off</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-signoff-procedure.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 20px;height: 22px;" />) next to it.</p>
        <h2>Access and modify Microsoft Word or Excel files</h2>
        <p>If a member of the engagement team has attached files from Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel to your engagement, they&apos;re added to the list of documents in the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>Select a file to open it to review the contents or make changes. If you enable editing in the Word or Excel file copy on your desktop, the file is locked for other users. If other members of the engagement team go to the Documents page and open the file, it opens in read-only mode. Once you&apos;ve closed the file, other users can edit.</p>
        <p>When a file is locked by a user, a lock icon with the user&apos;s initials shows on the Documents page next to the file.</p>
        <p class="image"><img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-documents-page-excel-file-locked-1134x320.png" alt="Lock icon to signify the document is locked" /></p><div class="pagebreak"></div><h2>Add annotations to PDF documents</h2>
        <p>If other members of your team attach a PDF document to the engagement, it is added to the document list in the <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
        <h3>Practice set</h3>
        <p>Select the PDF file to open it for review purposes or to add annotations. For example, you can add annotations to note work that you have performed or identify problems or potential inaccuracies.</p>
        <p>To add annotations in the PDF file, go to where you want to add your annotation and select to display the <b>Add Annotation</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-annotation-add-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />). Observe lo siguiente:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If you select anywhere inside the text, the icon shows on the right side at the end of the line.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you select anywhere in the white space, the icon shows at the selected spot.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="image"><img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-documents-pdf-add-annotation.png" alt="Add anotation to PDF file" /></p>
        <p>Select the icon to add an annotation at the indicated spot. From the dialog that displays, choose a <b>Purpose</b>, <b>Link</b> the annotation to a document or adjustment (if applicable) and enter a <b>Note</b>.</p>
        <p>Haga clic en <b>Guardar</b> para agregar el gráfico al panel de información. The <b>Annotation</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/icon-annotation-added.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 23px;height: 23px;" />) displays in the document to indicate the annotation type. Other engagement team members can view the annotation by hovering their cursor over it or by selecting it.</p>
