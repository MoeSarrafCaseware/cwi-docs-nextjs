        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> When users print documents, analysis charts that do not fit into one page will be broken across multiple pages. To ensure an analysis chart can be printed on a single page, take into consideration page limitations when authoring your analysis widgets. For example, you can break a large widget into smaller widgets.</p>
