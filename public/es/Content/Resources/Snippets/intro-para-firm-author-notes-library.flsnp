        <p>We recommend that you add the financial statements notes in the document template. When the author publishes the template, all the new <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PrintGuides.RCT">Caseware ReviewComp</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PrintGuides.OnPoint">OnPoint</MadCap:conditionalText> engagement files inherit those notes in the financial statements document.</p>
        <p>You can also set up the notes library. The Notes Library provides a pool of notes that allows users to easily find and add notes in the financial statements document. Notes are automatically organized in the library by categories. Categories are the available note titles in the document. The library also features a search field, where users can enter a keyword to filter notes.</p>
