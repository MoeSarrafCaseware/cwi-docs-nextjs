        <p>Smart Copy-Paste addresses the need to share content across products, which establishes the concept of <i>content reuse</i> in the Cloud Engagements platform.</p>
        <p>Content reuse is the practice of using existing content or pieces of content to develop new documents. It improves the process and quality of template authoring since maintenance of &quot;shared content&quot; is done in one central place. Once the shared content is ready to be reused, simply copy it to another product template.</p>
