        <p>The SE 2024-08 release introduces the central planning feature. Central planning allows users to sync risks, controls and selected checklists across engagements so the work doesn’t need to be duplicated in multiple engagements. To enable central planning in your product from the product settings, select <b>Enable Central Planning</b> on the <b>Central Planning</b> tab. You can then select which checklist documents in your template are synced. All risks and controls are synced by default.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/central-planning-product-settings.png" alt="The Central Planning tab of the product settings." /></p>
        <p>Firm authors are also able to modify which checklists are included when syncing to a central planning engagement. This allows firm authors to customize central planning to suit their firm and needs, as well as include firm author-created checklists.</p>
        <p>Once central planning is enabled in your product, users can then select <b>Set as Central Planning Engagement</b> in their engagement settings to designate engagements as central planning engagements.</p>
        <p>Note that this action is irreversible. Once an engagement is set as a central planning engagement, the checkbox cannot be deselected.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/central-planning-engagement-settings.png" alt="The Central Planning tab in the engagement settings." /></p>
        <p>To create an engagement that is synced to the central planning engagement, users can navigate to the central planning engagement in their cloud site and use the <b>Create Engagement from Source</b> option. Risks, controls and selected checklists in this new engagement will then automatically be synced from the central planning engagement.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/central-planning-create-engagement.png" alt="The Create Engagement from Source option for a centrally planned engagement." /></p>
        <p>In both central planning engagements and destination engagement that are synced to the central planning engagement, the <b>Central planning</b> (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-central-planning-top-menu.png" alt=" " style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) icon displays in the top menu bar. Note that the icon also displays next to synced checklists.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/central-planning-documents-page.png" alt="The Documents page of a centrally planned engagement with the Central planning icon in the top menu and next to a synced checklist." /></p>
        <p>Users can select the <b>Central planning</b> (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-central-planning-top-menu.png" alt=" " style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) icon in the top menu bar to open the <b>Central Planning Hub</b>. If the user is in the central planning engagement, they can view a list of the destination engagements and whether they are up to date. If they’re in a destination engagement, this page informs them if any changes have been made in the source engagement and allows them to sync those changes.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/central-planning-hub-destination-engagement.png" alt="The Central Planning Hub for a destination engagement." /></p>
        <p>If a user opens a synced checklist in a destination engagement, a message displays informing them that the document has been completed in the central planning engagement with a link to the checklist in that engagement. Risks and controls will continue to display in the destination engagements but in a read-only state.</p>

        <p>To support the release of the Analytics Hub to end users, there is now an <b>Analytics Hub</b> tab in the product settings. When you select <b>Enable Analytics Hub</b>, the Analytics Hub becomes available to end users in your product.</p>
        <p>To learn more about the Analytics Hub, see the <a href="https://developers.caseware.com/developers_content/v1/Data-Analytics/Whats-new-data-analytics.htm#AnalyticsHubforendusers">Data Analytics 2024-07 release notes</a>.</p>

        <p>To allow you to more easily find financial groups, a search option is now available on the <b>Financial groups</b> tabs on the <b>Data</b> page.</p>

        <h1>New for end users</h1>
        <p>Here is what&apos;s new for end users in SE 2024-08.</p>
        <h2>Ajustes recalculados</h2>
        <p>Users now have the ability to create calculated adjustments. When they add an account or group line to an adjustment, they now have the option to select <b>fx</b> in the <b>Amount</b> field and create a calculation to determine the adjustment amount.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/calculated-adjustment.png" alt="A calculated adjustment in the New Adjustment dialog." /></p>
        <p>Similarly to custom calculations in dynamic tables, users can reference trial balance data in their calculation. If the value of the referenced trial balance account or group is changed, a <b>Recalculate</b> button appears for the adjustment on the <b>Adjustments</b> page. Users can select this button to recalculate and update the adjustment amount.</p>
        <p>If more than one adjustment requires recalculation, users can also select the <b>Recalculate all</b> button at the top of the page to recalculate all adjustments at once.</p>
        <p>To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Accounts-and-Analysis/Post-adjustments-to-the-trial-balance.htm">Post adjustments to the trial balance</a>.</p>
