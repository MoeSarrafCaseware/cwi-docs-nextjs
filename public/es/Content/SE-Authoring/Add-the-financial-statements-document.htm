        <h1>Imprimir el documento de estados financieros</h1>
        <p>Financial statements are written records that convey the business activities and the financial performance of a company. They include the balance sheet, income statement and the statement of cash flows.</p>
        <p>You need to set up the financial statements document to prepare a complete automated solution. Users then find all the statements and notes they need to prepare a compliant set of financial statements document, where only the relevant content for a specific engagement displays.</p>
        <p>Once users import the trial balance, the financial statements document is automatically added in the Documents list in the engagement. They can review the document and make some changes to meet specific firm requirements. For information on the changes that users can make in the financial statements document, see <a href="What-financial-statements-features-are-available-for-users.htm">What can users modify in the financial statements?</a></p>
        <p>To create the financial statements document, select <b>Add (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-add-DocumentsPage.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />)</b> at the documents page, then choose <b>Financial Statements.</b> A blank financial statements document opens and you can now start authoring.</p>
