        <h1>Dimensions Allocation Worksheets</h1>
        <p><b>Dimensions allocation worksheets</b> have been developed to assist users in completing Nonprofit Organizations engagements. In other jurisdictions, these may be referred to as NFPs (Not-for-Profit entities) or Charities.</p>
        <p>These forms are intended to help users allocate financial groupings balances across dimensions in situations where the Trial Balance does not include those details at the account level.</p>
        <p>Once the <b>Dimensions allocation worksheets</b> have been integrated with your solution, you can add the forms by selecting <b>Add</b> (<img src="../Resources/Images/icon-add-15x15.png" alt=" " style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) menu on your <b>Documents</b> page. There are two SE Builder forms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Dimension allocation worksheets summary</b> - A repeater type document that can be duplicated as many times as required. One instance of this form is intended to be used to allocate the balances across one Dimension category at one time.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Dimension allocation worksheet</b> - A repeater SE Builder form which will include all of the allocation worksheets instances generated from the Dimension allocation worksheets summary documents. You must add this worksheet to your <b>Documents</b> page but you can always hide it by using the visibility settings.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To learn more about the <b>Dimensions allocation worksheets</b>, see <a href="https://cwi.casewarecloud.com/cwi/webapps/?id=23472&amp;returntype=UploadedFile">this recording</a>.</p>
        <p>To learn more about how to get access to the <b>Dimensions allocation worksheets</b> custom forms from the Global Components library, see <a href="https://developers.caseware.com/developers_content/v1/Get-started-with-Global-Components/Get-started-with-Dimensions-Allocation-Worksheets.htm">Get started with Dimensions allocation worksheets</a>.</p>
        <p>These worksheets seamlessly integrate with SE platform functionality around Dimensions, without requiring any additional code changes or Primary Author configurations for the use cases they are intended to solve.</p>
        <p>The concepts used to develop these worksheets can also be used for other types of allocations with some changes. If you are planning to make <u style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">significant changes</u> to the content or functionality of the SE Builder forms, such as adding, removing or modifying functionality, you will need code ownership. Refer to <a href="https://developers.caseware.com/developers_content/v1/Get-started-with-Global-Components/Get-started-with-Dimensions-Allocation-Worksheets.htm">Request access to the source code for the Dimensions allocation worksheets</a>.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you take code ownership, you must maintain the SE Builder forms going forward, which includes manually applying any future changes, updates and bug fixes that are deployed for the original form source.</p>
