        <h1><a name="Enable2"></a>Habilitar nuevo diseño de consulta</h1>
        <p>Queries are switching to a new and improved user interface. To enable the new query design in your product, select the <b>Information</b> icon (<img src="../Resources/Icons/information-icon1.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;height: 20px;" alt="" />) at the top menu and choose <b>Settings</b> to open the Product Settings dialog.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Make sure the query functionality is enabled in the product.json file, otherwise, the <b>Queries</b> tab will not be available. To learn more, see <a href="Enable-or-disable-features-in-your-product.htm">Enable or disable features in your product.</a></p>
        <p>At <b>Features</b> | <b>Queries</b>, select <b>Enable new query layout</b>.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> We strongly advise that you test the new design on existing queries in your product before enabling it in the production environment.</p>
        <p>Once you enable the new query layout, you can also enable the <b>Simple Electronic Signature</b> response type. This response type allows users to upload documents that require client signatures, such as engagement terms, and send them to clients to accept electronically. Contacts can choose whether to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Accept electronically</b> - Select the Accept button to sign. Contacts can also choose to share their location data when they sign which will be recorded in the signature log.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Upload signed document</b> - Download the attached document, then insert the signature or print and sign the document manually and upload.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Copy signed document from Cloud</b> - Select the previously downloaded, signed and uploaded document from the firm&apos;s Cloud site.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If clients choose to accept electronically, a signature log is generated and available for download. The log includes the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Query question details</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signer name and email</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signer location (if the clients have chosen to enable location access)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signer IP Address</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Signature date</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Título</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Document MD5 hash</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To enable this response type, select the <b>Enable simple electronic signature in response types</b> checkbox.</p>
