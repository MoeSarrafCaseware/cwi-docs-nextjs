        <h1><a name="Network"></a>Autor de la red</h1><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/opening-line-SE-roles.flsnp" /><p>The network author role enables accountancy networks and associations, as well as large firms with multiple offices, to customize product templates provided by primary authors and share those templates with all their member firms. This allows accountancy networks to easily maintain a standard methodology across their member firms, while still giving member firms the flexibility to make further customizations as required for their region.</p>
        <p>To manage the network firm template in a central location, accountancy networks will have a Cloud site specifically for network authoring in addition to Cloud sites for each of the member firms in the network. Users from the member firms that the network wants to designate as network authors can be added to the network authoring firm site.</p>
        <p><b>Goal:</b> Customize the default product content to meet specific network needs. Firm customizations include adding content and modifying or suppressing the default content. To learn more about what network authors can customize, see the topics under <b>Template Management</b> in the <a href="https://docs.caseware.com/latest/webapps/en/Engagements/Authoring-index.htm">end user help</a>.</p>
