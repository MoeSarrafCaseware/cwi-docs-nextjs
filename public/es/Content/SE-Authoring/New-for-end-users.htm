        <h1>New for end users</h1>
        <p>Here is what&apos;s new for end users in SE 2024-09.</p>
        <h2>Issues for dynamic table rows</h2>
        <p>Users can now add issues to dynamic table rows. The Issues icon displays when users hover the cursor over the right side of a dynamic table row. They can then select the icon to add an issue.</p>
        <p>Tenga en cuenta que:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Issues added to a child row are displayed at the parent level when the group of rows is collapsed. When the row is expanded, the issues display at the row they were added to.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If a row should be hidden due to visibility logic, it will continue to display if an issue is attached to it and it is either outstanding or resolved. The row will be hidden if the issue is cleared. Note that whether an issue is attached to a hidden row or not, that row will not be included when printing the document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If an issue is added to a row and the row is later deleted, the issue is moved to the dynamic table at the table level.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that issues cannot be added to page break rows.</p>
        <h2>Improvement to syncing trial balance</h2>
        <p>A warning message now displays to users when they attempt to sync their trial balance from another engagement. After they select the <b>Confirm</b> button, this new message displays and informs them that syncing the trial balance is an irreversible action.</p>
        <h2>Filter adjustments</h2>
        <p>A new <b>All types</b> dropdown is now available on the <b>Adjustments</b> page to allow users to filter adjustments by type. When users select to export their adjustments, only the filtered adjustments are included in the generated file. This allows users to select only the types of adjustments they need and provide a copy of them to their clients.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/Dropdown-Filters.png" alt="Filtering adjustments by type." /></p>
        <h2>Saved views for the Data page</h2>
        <p>The Save views icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/SaveViewsIcon.png" alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) is now available on the Data page to allow users to save their current view and access previously saved views.</p>
        <p>When users save a view, their selections for the following settings are saved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Columnas</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Indicadores</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Filtros</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Variación</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ajustes de división</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Filas por página:</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Saved views are available to all users in the engagement file.</p>
