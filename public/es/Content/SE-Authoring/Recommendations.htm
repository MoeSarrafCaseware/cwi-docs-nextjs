        <h1>Recomendado</h1>
        <p>For a smooth authoring experience, we recommend that you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use Google Chrome</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a standardized design documents for content authoring</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="Distribute-the-template.htm#To">Save</a> your template draft frequently</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Communicate between team members on saving and deleting drafts</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that multiple authors can author simultaneously. However, we recommend that authors are always assigned different sections to avoid overwriting each others work. Por ejemplo:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In a checklist document, multiple writers can work on the same document as long as they are assigned different procedures</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the financial statements, multiple writers can work on the same document at the same time as long as they are assigned different dynamic tables, text sections, analysis sections or note sections</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In queries, multiple authors can work on the same document at the same time as long as they are assigned different questions</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
