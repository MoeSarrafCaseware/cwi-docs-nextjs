        <h3>Envision</h3>
        <p>Envision provides a quick visualization of the transaction data that’s been imported into an AnalyticsAI engagement.</p>
        <p>Envision is divided into several widgets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Descripción general</li>
            <li>Resumen</li>
            <li>Distribuida</li>
            <li>Campo de fecha de registro</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/aai-da10-graphs.png" alt="AnalyticsAI Envision" /></p>

        <h2>Notebooks</h2>
        <p>Notebooks are interactive documents that contain live code together with markdown text. Using Notebooks, you can build and explore custom analysis, and display the results. Each notebook consists of a series of cells. Run each cell individually in sequence to view its output or run the entire notebook.</p>
        <p>Notebook files have the .ipynb file name extension and can be explored, modified and run in JupyterLab, an open-source notebook editor. The Data Analytics team has re-engineered out-of-the box Analytics AI tests to work with a new Notebooks engine. You can access these from the AnalyticsAI platform.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Launch-a-notebook.flsnp" /><p><b>Note:</b> The initial launch of a CWI Notebook in an engagement by each user may take several minutes. The Data Analytics team is working on reducing the initial load times. Changes made in notebooks, including those in the code cells as well as the markdown cells, are not saved.</p>
