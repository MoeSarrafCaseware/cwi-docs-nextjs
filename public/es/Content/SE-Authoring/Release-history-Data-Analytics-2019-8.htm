        <h1>AnalyticsAI 2019.8</h1>
        <p>This highlights the major changes since the last release of this product.</p>
        <h2>Configuration page improvements</h2>
        <p>When the dates in a data file don’t match the engagement’s dates, the Run tests on drop-down now appears on the Configuration page. You can run tests on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Todos los datos</li>
            <li>Ejercicio en curso</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, the <b>Save &amp; Run Tests</b> button is now called <b>Run Tests</b>.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/run-on-all-data.png" alt="Running tests on all data in AnalyticsAI" /></p>
        <h2>Style Improvements to Tagging Dropdown</h2>
        <p>These improvements have been made to the <b>Import as</b> dialog that appears when you are mapping an imported <code>.csv</code> transactions file:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>Select</b> button has been removed. Now, simply click an available item in the list to select it.</li>
            <li>The arrows that appeared beside each potential selection have been removed.</li>
            <li>Unused properties that were visible during the transactions file mapping process have been hidden in this release.</li>
        </ul>
