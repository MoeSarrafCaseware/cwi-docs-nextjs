        <p>Here are samples for some of the most common response types.</p>
        <h2>Single selection list displayed inline and Picklist displayed inline</h2>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/common-resoponse-types.PNG" alt="Common response types - Single selection list" /></p>
        <p>Choose this layout when there are a small number of responses (2 to 3) and you want them to be easily seen by the user. Here is how to set it up:</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/common-resoponse-types-01.PNG" alt="Common response type - picklist" /></p>
        <h2>Multiple rows of responses</h2>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/common-resoponse-types-02.PNG" alt="Common response type - Multiple rows of responses" /></p>
        <p>Choose this layout when the number of responses is not known (but is generally less than 3 to 5). Here is how to set it up:</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/common-resoponse-types-03.PNG" /></p>
        <h2>Multiple responses arranged beneath procedure</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="../Resources/Images/common-resoponse-types-04.PNG" alt="Multi-row response arranged beneath procedure" /></p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak />
        <p>Choose this layout when the number of responses can become numerous (more than 5). Here is how to set it up:</p>
