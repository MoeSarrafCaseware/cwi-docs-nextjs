        <h1>What&apos;s the engagement glossary?</h1>
        <p>A glossary is a list of terms with a definition for each term. In SE, you can define terms in the Engagement Glossary to be reused in all the documents of the template. Terms can be words or phrases. If you modify a term in the glossary, it changes in all its occurrences in the product.</p>
        <p>The engagement glossary consists of groups that contain related terms. Each term in the glossary must be in a group. You can&apos;t add a term if there are no groups in the glossary.</p>
