        <h2>Autor de la red</h2>
        <p><a href="Network-author.htm">#networkauthor</a></p>
        <p>SE 2024-09 features the official launch of the network author role.</p>
        <p>The network author role enables accountancy networks and associations, as well as large firms with multiple offices, to customize product templates provided by primary authors and share those templates with all their member firms. This allows accountancy networks to easily maintain a standard methodology across their member firms, while still giving member firms the flexibility to make further customizations as required for their region.</p>
        <p>To manage the network firm template in a central location, accountancy networks will have a Cloud site specifically for network authoring in addition to Cloud sites for each of the member firms in the network. Users from the member firms that the network wants to designate as network authors can be added to the network authoring firm site.</p>
        <p>In the network authoring firm, network authors can access the template provided by primary authors on the Manage template page in their settings. From this page, they can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Create a draft and make customizations to the template</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Save the template so they can test it</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Publish the template and make it available to all the member firms in their network</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Restore previous versions of the template</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> Any customizations made by network authors cannot be overridden by new updates made to the product template by primary authors.</p>
        <p>Once their work is complete, network authors can then share this template with their member firms, where firm authors can make additional customizations. Note that member firms will always receive their templates from the network authoring firm and not directly from primary authors.</p>
        <h3>Additional authoring capabilities</h3>
        <p>In addition to the features already available to firm authors, network authors also have access to customize the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Riesgos</b><br />Network authors have the ability to customize all items on the Assessment, Fields, and Scales tabs of the Risks section in the product settings. Note that while network authors also have access to the General tab, the option to enable the new Risks page and the Library management section is still only available to primary authors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Controles</b><br />If controls are enabled by primary authors, network authors can customize all controls settings. Note that they do not have the ability to disable controls.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Afirmaciones</b><br />All items in the Assertions tab of the product settings are available to network authors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Documents page</b> <br />Network authors can modify the names, identifiers and visibility settings of primary author-created documents, as well as reorder primary author-created folders and subfolders. They can also add, rename and reorder phases from the product settings dialog.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Listas de verificación</b><br />Network authors can modify visibility settings for items within a checklist and can also add annotations for procedures.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Translation for the financial statements</h2>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a> <a href="End-user.htm">#enduser</a></p>
        <p>You can now enable automatic machine translation for the financial statements. When you make this feature available in your product, users can translate text sections in the financial statements to any of the content languages available in your product.</p>
        <p>To enable this feature, select the <b>Enable translation</b> checkbox in the <b>Financial Statements</b> tab of the product settings and ensure you have more than one content language enabled in your template.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/ProductSettingsEnableTranslation.png" title="Producto" alt="Enabling translations in the financial statements." /></p>
        <p>Users can then select the <b>Translation</b> option in the financial statements settings to enable translation for the document. The <b>Translation</b> icon then appears next to text sections in the document.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/TranslationExample.png" alt="Example of a financial statement with Translation icons." /></p>
        <p>When users select the translation icon, the <b>Translation</b> dialog opens. From this dialog, they can select which language to translate the content to, view the translation, and select <b>Save</b> to apply it to the text section.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/TranslationDialog.png" alt="Using the Translation dialog." /></p>
        <p>The translated version of the text section displays in the engagement when the user switches the content language of the engagement to the target language. They can then make manual edits to the text if required.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/TranslationExample.png" alt="Example of a translation in a financial statement." /></p>
        <h2>Custom calculations in financial statement text sections</h2>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a> <a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a> <a href="Network-author.htm">#networkauthor</a> <a href="End-user.htm">#enduser</a></p>
        <p>You can now add custom calculations to text sections in the financial statements. Similarly to custom calculations in dynamic tables, you can reference trial balance values and dynamic table cells in your calculations. These calculations will update automatically if the referenced values change.</p>
        <p><img src="../Resources/Images/NewArea.png" alt="Add custom calculations to text sections in financial statements. " /></p>
        <h2>Cell references within the financial statements</h2>

        <p>This release introduces cell referencing within the financial statements. You can now reference values from one dynamic table into another. This eliminates the need to manually enter the same value multiple times in different tables in the financial statements.</p>
        <h2>Custom formulas for the Overall Materiality Table</h2>
        <p><a href="Primary-author.htm">#primaryauthor</a> <a href="Firm-author.htm">#firmauthor</a> <a href="Network-author.htm">#networkauthor</a> <a href="End-user.htm">#enduser</a></p>
