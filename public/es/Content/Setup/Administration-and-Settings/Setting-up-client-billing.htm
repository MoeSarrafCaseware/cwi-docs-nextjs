You can avoid repetitive work by creating invoice templates that match your organization&apos;s standards, and collect time and expense data directly through Cloud to populate your newly created invoices.</p>

        <p>Begin by updating the default appearance of invoices.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To-edit-invoice-defaults.flsnp" /><h2 id="Create-invoice-templates">Create invoice templates</h2>
        <p>After establishing invoice defaults, you can create invoice templates for regular clients or tasks. If your organization works with the same company on annual basis, you could create an invoice template specific to that company&apos;s needs. You could also create a general template for nonprofits if you organization works in that area.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To-create-an-invoice-template.flsnp" /><h2 id="Add-custom-billing-codes">Add custom billing codes</h2>
        <p>Now that you&apos;ve established the basic form of your invoices, you&apos;ll want to set up your organization&apos;s billing codes. While Cloud has several billing codes included by default, you may wish to add more to match the work done by your organization. For example, you might add the code AUD for audit services or CST for consulting work.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To-add-a-billing-code.flsnp" /><h2 id="Ensuring-staff-members-submit-time-entries">Ensuring staff members submit time entries</h2>
        <p>Your invoices depend on prompt and accurate time and expense entries from your organization&apos;s staff. To make sure that you receive this information in a timely manner, you can set up automatic email notifications. These emails can remind staff to complete their timesheets, or to finalize their pending entries.</p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/To-configure-weekly-email-notificatiosn-for-time-entries.flsnp" /></body>
