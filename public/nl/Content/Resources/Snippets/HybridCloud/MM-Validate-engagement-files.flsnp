        <p>We suggest that you validate your organization's engagement files to determine if they are ready for <a href="../../../Explore/Hybrid-Cloud/Migrate-large-data-sets-using-the-Migration-Manager.htm#Migrate-engagement-files-to-Cloud">migration to Cloud</a>. Some common issues that will prevent validation of a file include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The file is corrupt</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The file is a sync copy rather than a parent file</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The file's name includes unicode characters</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The file's version is older than Working Papers 2011</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The compressed file does not include subfolders</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If possible, ensure that you resolve these issues prior to validation. If any of these issues are discovered after a validation attempt, resolve them and try the validation again.</p>
